    "Grammar error in template text: 'essential for [verb base form]' appears in articles 0 and 5, producing ungrammatical English ('essential for make conversation', 'essential for apologize'). Should be 'essential for making/apologizing'.",
    "Bracket inconsistency in pronunciation fields: Some articles include brackets in pronunciation values (e.g., '[zhuh TEHM]') while others don't. The rendering template adds its own brackets, causing double brackets ('[ [zhuh TEHM] ]') in the HTML for articles that include them in source.",
    "Missing French diacritical marks: Article 3 (French word order) systematically omits accents on past participles and common words in teaching tables (francais, interessant, deuxieme, aime, mange, cuisine, epouser). This is a significant pedagogical issue as accents change pronunciation and sometimes meaning in French.",
    "Import statements in content field: 6 of 12 articles contain Astro import statements in the content field. These are correctly stripped from content_html rendering, so this is a data cleanliness issue rather than a user-facing bug.",
