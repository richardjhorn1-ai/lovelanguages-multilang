## Content Expansion Strategy

### Phase 1: New Native Languages (High Priority)

Add content for German and Italian native speakers - large markets with 0 content.

**Target: 50 articles each for DE→PL and IT→PL**

| Language Pair | Topic Priority | Article Count Goal |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 🇩🇪 DE → 🇵🇱 PL | German speakers learning Polish | 50 |
| 🇮🇹 IT → 🇵🇱 PL | Italian speakers learning Polish | 50 |

**How to generate:**
```bash
cd blog
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx npm run generate -- \
  --language pl \
  --nativeLanguage de \
  --topic "Polish greetings for German speakers" \
  --category phrases
```

### Phase 2: Expand High-Demand Target Languages

Increase EN→ES and EN→FR from 10 to 50+ articles (massive search volume).

| Language Pair | Current | Target |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇪🇸 ES | 10 | 50 |
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇫🇷 FR | 10 | 50 |
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇩🇪 DE | 10 | 50 |
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇮🇹 IT | 10 | 50 |

### Phase 3: Cross-Pollinate Content

For each well-performing EN article, create ES and FR versions with same slug for hreflang benefits.

**Process:**
1. Identify top 20 EN→PL articles by traffic
2. Create ES→PL and FR→PL versions with SAME slug
3. Hreflang tags will auto-connect them

### Essential Article Topics (Per Language Pair)

Every language pair should have these core articles:

- [ ] "How to Say I Love You in [Language]"
- [ ] "50 [Language] Pet Names & Endearments"
- [ ] "100 Most Common [Language] Words"
- [ ] "[Language] Pronunciation Guide"
- [ ] "Is [Language] Hard to Learn?"
- [ ] "[Language] Grammar Basics for Beginners"
- [ ] "Romantic [Language] Phrases for Couples"
- [ ] "Meeting Your [Language] Partner's Parents"
- [ ] "[Language] vs [Native Language]: Key Differences"
- [ ] "[Language] Date Night Vocabulary"

### Content Generation Commands

**Single article:**
```bash
npm run generate -- -l pl -t "Topic" -c vocabulary -d beginner
```

**Batch generation (run multiple times):**
```bash
# German speakers learning Polish
for topic in "greetings" "pet names" "pronunciation" "grammar basics" "i love you"; do
  npm run generate -- -l pl --nativeLanguage de -t "Polish $topic for German speakers" -c phrases
done
```

### Priority Order

1. **DE→PL** (50 articles) - Large German market, 0 competition on your site
2. **IT→PL** (50 articles) - Growing Italian interest in Polish
3. **EN→ES** (40 more) - Massive search volume
4. **EN→FR** (40 more) - High search volume
5. **PT→PL** (50 articles) - Portuguese speakers, underserved market
