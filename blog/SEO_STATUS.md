## Content Expansion Strategy

### Phase 1: Polish Content for New Native Languages ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

German, Italian, and Portuguese native speakers now have content, but Polish as target is weak.

**Current State:**
| Language Pair | Current | Target | Status |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------|
| 🇩🇪 DE → 🇵🇱 PL | 0 | 50 | ❌ Needs creation |
| 🇮🇹 IT → 🇵🇱 PL | 3 | 50 | ⚠️ Needs expansion |
| 🇵🇹 PT → 🇵🇱 PL | 3 | 50 | ⚠️ Needs expansion |

**How to generate:**
```bash
cd blog
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxx npm run generate -- \
  --language pl \
  --nativeLanguage de \
  --topic "Polish greetings for German speakers" \
  --category phrases
```

### Phase 2: Expand High-Demand Target Languages ✅ COMPLETE

EN→ES, EN→FR, EN→DE, EN→IT now have 25 articles each.

| Language Pair | Current | Target | Status |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------|
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇪🇸 ES | 25 | 50 | ⚠️ Halfway |
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇫🇷 FR | 25 | 50 | ⚠️ Halfway |
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇩🇪 DE | 25 | 50 | ⚠️ Halfway |
| 🇬🇧 EN → 🇮🇹 IT | 25 | 50 | ⚠️ Halfway |

### Phase 3: Cross-Pollinate Content

For each well-performing EN article, create ES and FR versions with same slug for hreflang benefits.

**Process:**
1. Identify top 20 EN→PL articles by traffic
2. Create ES→PL and FR→PL versions with SAME slug
3. Hreflang tags will auto-connect them

### Essential Article Topics (Per Language Pair)

Every language pair should have these core articles:

- [ ] "How to Say I Love You in [Language]"
- [ ] "50 [Language] Pet Names & Endearments"
- [ ] "100 Most Common [Language] Words"
- [ ] "[Language] Pronunciation Guide"
- [ ] "Is [Language] Hard to Learn?"
- [ ] "[Language] Grammar Basics for Beginners"
- [ ] "Romantic [Language] Phrases for Couples"
- [ ] "Meeting Your [Language] Partner's Parents"
- [ ] "[Language] vs [Native Language]: Key Differences"
- [ ] "[Language] Date Night Vocabulary"

### Content Generation Commands

**Single article:**
```bash
npm run generate -- -l pl -t "Topic" -c vocabulary -d beginner
```

**Batch generation (run multiple times):**
```bash
# German speakers learning Polish
for topic in "greetings" "pet names" "pronunciation" "grammar basics" "i love you"; do
  npm run generate -- -l pl --nativeLanguage de -t "Polish $topic for German speakers" -c phrases
done
```

### Priority Order (Updated)

1. **DE→PL** (50 articles) - German market, currently 0 articles
2. **IT→PL** (47 more) - Currently only 3 articles
3. **PT→PL** (47 more) - Currently only 3 articles
4. **EN→ES** (25 more) - Currently 25, target 50
5. **EN→FR** (25 more) - Currently 25, target 50
6. **Minor languages** - Expand 8-article pairs to 15+
