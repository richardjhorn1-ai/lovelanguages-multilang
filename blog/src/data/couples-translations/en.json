        "question": "What's the best language for couples to learn together?",
        "answer": "Spanish, French, and Italian are excellent choices for couples due to their romantic nature and relative ease for English speakers. Spanish offers the most practical benefits with 500+ million speakers, while French and Italian are traditionally associated with romance and culture."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can we stay motivated learning together?",
        "answer": "Set shared goals, practice conversations daily, watch movies in your target language together, plan trips to countries where the language is spoken, and celebrate milestones together. Making it a shared hobby rather than a chore keeps both partners engaged."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should we learn at the same pace?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. It's natural for one partner to progress faster. The key is supporting each other and using the difference as an opportunity—the faster learner can help teach and reinforce concepts for both of you."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much time should we dedicate daily?",
        "answer": "Even 15-30 minutes of daily practice together is effective. Consistency matters more than duration. Try incorporating language into daily activities: morning greetings, meal conversations, or bedtime phrases."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if one partner loses interest?",
        "answer": "Focus on making it fun rather than academic. Try cooking recipes in the target language, playing language learning games together, or planning a trip that requires the language. Sometimes a change in approach reignites motivation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can we learn different languages?",
        "answer": "You can, but learning the same language creates more opportunities for practice and shared experiences. If you have different interests, consider learning one language first together, then exploring individual interests later."
