## How to Practice Together

Learning greetings becomes magical when you practice with your partner. Start each morning with "Dzień dobry, kochanie" and end each night with "Dobranoc, moje serce." Create a ritual of greeting each other in Polish whenever you separate and reunite.

**Pro tip:** Record your partner saying these phrases correctly, then practice during your commute. When visiting [Poland to meet their family](/learn/pt/pl/meeting-your-polish-partners-family/), you'll feel confident greeting everyone from babcia to cousins.

Common mistake: Don't confuse "Cześć" (hi/bye) with "Cieszę się" (I'm pleased). The pronunciation is similar but meanings differ significantly!
