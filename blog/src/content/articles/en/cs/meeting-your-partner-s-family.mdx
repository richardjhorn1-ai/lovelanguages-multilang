Meeting your Czech partner's family is a beautiful milestone in your relationship. Whether you're visiting their childhood home in Prague or joining a Sunday lunch in Brno, speaking even basic Czech will show your genuine commitment to their culture and loved ones. These carefully chosen phrases will help you make a warm first impression and navigate those precious family moments with confidence.

<PhraseOfDay
  word="T캩코칤 m캩"
  translation="Nice to meet you"
  pronunciation="TEH-shee myeh"
  context="The perfect greeting when meeting each family member - use this immediately upon introduction!"
/>

## Before You Arrive: Essential Preparation

Czech families are known for their warmth and hospitality, but they also appreciate when visitors show respect for their traditions. A few well-placed Czech words can transform you from "partner's foreign friend" to "part of the family."

<VocabCard
  word="Rodina"
  translation="Family"
  pronunciation="ROH-dee-nah"
  example="Va코e rodina je moc mil치." (Your family is very nice.)"
/>

<CultureTip flag="游뻟릖" title="Bring a Gift">
Czech etiquette values thoughtfulness over extravagance. A small gift like flowers for mom (always an odd number!) or quality chocolate shows respect. When handing it over, say "To je pro v치s" (This is for you - pronounced "toh yeh proh vahss").
</CultureTip>

## Meeting the Parents: First Impressions Matter

This is your moment to shine! Czech parents appreciate humility and genuine effort over perfect grammar.

<VocabCard
  word="Maminka"

  pronunciation="MAH-meen-kah"
  example="Dobr칳 den, maminko!" (Hello, mom! - shows affection)"

<CultureTip flag="游뻟릖" title="Addressing Parents">
Use "pan칤" (Mrs.) and "pan" (Mr.) with their surname initially. Only use first names if invited. The affectionate "maminka" (mom) and "tat칤nek" (dad) might be used by your partner, but wait for permission before using them yourself.

### Small Talk Topics

## Polite Phrases and Formality

Czech has formal and informal forms of address. With family, you'll mostly use informal, but start formal and follow your partner's lead.

**Formal (use with elders initially):**
- **Vy** (you formal) - "vih"
- **Jak se m치te?** - "How are you?" (formal)
- **D캩kuji** - "Thank you" (formal)

**Informal (use with peers, once invited):**
- **Ty** (you informal) - "tih"
- **Jak se m치코?** - "How are you?" (informal)
- **D칤ky** - "Thanks" (casual)

## Pro Tips for Success

1. **Bring photos**: Czech families love seeing pictures of your hometown, family, and life. It's a great conversation starter.

2. **Learn their names**: Practice pronouncing each family member's name correctly. Ask your partner to help you practice beforehand.

3. **Offer to help**: Simple phrases like "M콢쬿 pomoci?" (Can I help? - MOO-zhoo POH-moh-tsee) show you're not just a guest but family.

4. **Try everything**: Even if you're not hungry, taste everything offered. Say "ochutn치m" (I'll taste - OH-khoo-tnahm) enthusiastically.

5. **Ask about traditions**: Czechs are proud of their culture. Ask "Jak칠 jsou 캜esk칠 tradice?" (What are Czech traditions? - YAH-keh ysoh CHESS-keh trah-DEE-tseh).

6. **Compliment their home**: Say "M치te kr치sn칳 byt/d콢m" (You have a beautiful apartment/house - MAH-teh KRAHS-neeh beet/doom).

<CultureTip flag="游뻟릖" title="Sunday Lunch Tradition">
Many Czech families gather for a large Sunday lunch. This is often the main family meal with multiple courses. Plan to stay several hours and pace yourself - refusing food completely is considered rude, but you can manage portions by saying "trochu, pros칤m" (a little, please - TROKH-oo PROH-seem).
