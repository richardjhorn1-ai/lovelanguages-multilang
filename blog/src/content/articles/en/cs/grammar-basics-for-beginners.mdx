Starting your Czech learning journey together? Understanding basic grammar patterns will help you express your feelings clearly and avoid confusion when talking with your partner.

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Miluji tě"
  english="I love you"
  pronunciation="MEE-loo-yee tye"
  context="The most important phrase - uses the verb 'milovat' (to love) in first person singular."

## The Simple Explanation: How Czech Grammar Works

Think of Czech grammar like building with LEGO blocks. Each piece (word) has a specific shape (ending) that determines how it connects to other pieces. Unlike English, Czech words change their endings based on their role in the sentence - but there are clear patterns to follow!

The good news? Czech speakers are incredibly forgiving with learners. Your partner will appreciate your effort, even if you make mistakes. Plus, many grammatical patterns follow logical rules that become intuitive with practice.

<CultureTip flag="🇨🇿" title="Grammar Matters in Romance">
Czech has formal and informal ways of addressing people. Once you're comfortable with your partner, you'll use informal "ty" (you). But learning both forms shows respect for Czech culture!
</CultureTip>

## The Basics: 5 Core Rules

### 1. Word Order is Flexible
Unlike English, Czech word order is quite flexible. The subject (who's doing the action) doesn't always come first.

**Example**: *Tě miluji* (I love you) works just as well as *Miluji tě*. Both mean the same thing!

### 2. Gender Affects Everything
Every noun has a gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) that affects pronouns, adjectives, and verb forms.

<VocabCard
  word="milý / milá / milé"
  translation="dear/sweet (m/f/n)"
  pronunciation="MEE-lee / MEE-lah / MEE-leh"
  example="Můj milý přítel, má milá přítelkyně, milé dítě"
/>

### 3. Cases Change Word Endings
Czech has 7 cases that show a word's relationship to other words. Think of them as relationship labels:
- **Nominative**: Who/what is doing something
- **Accusative**: Who/what is receiving the action
- **Genitive**: Who/what something belongs to

### 4. Verbs Conjugate by Person
Verbs change based on who's doing the action:

<ConjugationTable
  verb="být (to be)"
  meaning="to be"
  conjugations={[
    { person: "I", polish: "jsem", english: "I am" },
    { person: "You (informal)", polish: "jsi", english: "you are" },
    { person: "He/She", polish: "je", english: "he/she is" },
    { person: "We", polish: "jsme", english: "we are" },
    { person: "You (plural)", polish: "jste", english: "you all are" },
    { person: "They", english: "they are", polish: "jsou" }
  ]}
/>

### 5. Adjectives Match Nouns
Adjectives must agree with the gender and case of the noun they describe.

## Couples-Focused Examples

Here's how these patterns work in romantic contexts:

| Czech Phrase | English Translation | Grammar Note |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Miluji tě** | I love you | Verb + accusative pronoun |
| **Jsi krásná** | You're beautiful | Informal "you" + adjective (feminine) |
| **Chci tě objmout** | I want to hug you | Verb chain: want + to hug + you |
| **Jsi můj život** | You are my life | "To be" verb + possessive + noun |
| **Mám tě rád** | I like you (romantic) | "To have" verb + you + glad (masculine) |

<VocabCard
  word="Mám tě rád / Mám tě ráda"
  translation="I like you (m/f speaker)"
  pronunciation="mahm tye rahd / mahm tye RAH-dah"
  example="Mám tě rád, miláčku."
/>

<CultureTip flag="🇨🇿" title="Expressing Feelings">
Czechs often use "Mám tě rád/ráda" more frequently than "Miluji tě" in daily life. It's softer and more natural for everyday expressions of affection.
</CultureTip>

## Common Patterns for Daily Use

### Present Tense Patterns
Most Czech verbs follow regular patterns in present tense:

**Type 1 (-at verbs)**:
- *milovat* (to love) → já miluji, ty miluješ, on/ona miluje

**Type 2 (-it verbs)**:
- *prosit* (to ask/please) → já prosím, ty prosíš, on/ona prosí

### Making Questions
Simply add a question mark and raise your voice at the end:
- *Miluješ mě?* (Do you love me?)
- *Chceš jít ven?* (Do you want to go out?)

### Negative Forms
Add "ne-" to the beginning of verbs:
- *Nemiluji* (I don't love)
- *Nechci* (I don't want)

## Practice Sentences for Couples

Try these with your partner:

1. **Jak se máš?** (How are you?) - *yahk seh mahsh*
2. **Jsi moje láska.** (You are my love.) - *yee-SOH moh-yeh LAHS-kah*
3. **Chci být s tebou.** (I want to be with you.) - *kh-tsee beet steh-boh*
4. **Myslím na tebe.** (I'm thinking of you.) - *MIS-leem nah teh-beh*
5. **Jsi krásný/krásná.** (You're handsome/beautiful.) - *yee-SOH KRAHS-nee/KRAHS-nah*
6. **Miluju tvůj úsměv.** (I love your smile.) - *MEE-loo-yee tvooy OOS-myev*
7. **Jsi můj/moje všechno.** (You are my everything.) - *yee-SOH mooy/MOH-yeh FSKH-noh*
