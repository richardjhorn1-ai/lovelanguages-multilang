<CultureTip title="When to Say It" flag="游뻟릖">
In Czech culture, saying "miluji t캩" is a significant declaration. Czechs tend to be more reserved with verbal expressions of love compared to some cultures. When you say these words, your partner will know you truly mean them.

## Formal vs. Informal

Czech has formal and informal forms of "you." With your partner, you'll always use the informal:

| Phrase | Usage | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Miluji t캩 | Informal (partner, family) | I love you |
| Miluji v치s | Formal or plural | I love you (formal) |

> **Note:** You might also hear **Miluju t캩** - this is a more colloquial form of the same expression, equally affectionate and commonly used.
