## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't use "Ahoj" in formal situations with older Czechs
- "Dobrý den" literally means "good day" but you can use it all day
- Avoid mixing formal/informal forms—stick to one level per conversation
- Remember that Czech friends often greet with kisses on both cheeks

Master these greetings and farewells, and you'll create countless beautiful moments throughout your days together. Each "ahoj" and "na shledanou" becomes a small love note, a reminder that you're thinking of your partner and their culture. Start with just five favorites, practice them until they feel natural, then gradually add more to your shared vocabulary.
