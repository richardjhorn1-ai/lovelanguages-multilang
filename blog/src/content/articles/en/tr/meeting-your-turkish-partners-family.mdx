Meeting your Turkish partner's family is a significant milestone. In Turkish culture, family approval matters deeply, and making a good first impression can set the foundation for your future together. This guide will prepare you with the language, customs, and cultural knowledge you need to win over your partner's family.

## Your First Greeting

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Memnun oldum"
  translation="Nice to meet you / I am pleased"
  pronunciation="mem-NOON ol-DOOM"
  context="The essential phrase when meeting anyone for the first time. Said while shaking hands or after kisses on the cheek, this shows you are happy to meet them."
/>

First impressions matter enormously in Turkish culture. Here is how to start right:

<VocabCard

  translation="Hello, I am [your name]"
  pronunciation="mer-HAH-bah, ben..."
  example="Merhaba, ben Michael, memnun oldum."
/>

<VocabCard

  example="Cok sey duydum sizin hakkinizda, hep iyi seyler."
/>

<CultureTip title="The Greeting Ritual" flag="🇹🇷">
Turkish greetings often involve kisses on both cheeks, especially between women and between women and men. With the father, a firm handshake is usually appropriate first meeting. Follow your partner's lead. Elders may offer their hand palm-down for you to kiss the back of - this is a sign of respect you should accept.

## Essential Polite Phrases

### Formal Respect

Turkish has formal and informal "you." Always use formal **siz** with your partner's family, especially at first:

<VocabCard
  word="Nasilsiniz?"
  translation="How are you? (formal)"
  pronunciation="NAH-suhl-suh-nuhz"

<CultureTip title="Sen vs. Siz" flag="🇹🇷">
Using **siz** (formal you) instead of **sen** (informal you) with elders is crucial. Even after years of knowing them, many Turkish people continue using siz with their in-laws. When in doubt, use siz. They may eventually invite you to use sen, which is an honor and sign of acceptance.
