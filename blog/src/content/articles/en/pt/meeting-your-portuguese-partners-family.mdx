<CultureTip

  flag="🇵🇹"

  Portuguese-speaking families are physically affectionate. Expect kisses on the cheek (one in Brazil, two in Portugal), hugs, and people standing close during conversation. Don't be startled—it's a sign of warmth and acceptance!
</CultureTip>

<CultureTip
  title="Family Comes First"
  flag="🇵🇹"
>
  In both Brazilian and Portuguese cultures, family bonds are extremely important. Be prepared for large family gatherings, frequent phone calls with relatives, and your partner wanting to spend significant time with their family. Embracing this aspect of the culture will strengthen your relationship.
</CultureTip>

<CultureTip
  title="Respect for Elders"
  flag="🇵🇹"
>
  Always show extra respect to grandparents and older family members. Let them speak, listen attentively, and use formal address until invited to be more casual. In Portuguese culture, the wisdom of elders is highly valued.

Practice these phrases, bring a thoughtful gift, and most importantly, be yourself. The love you share with your partner will shine through, and that's what truly matters.
