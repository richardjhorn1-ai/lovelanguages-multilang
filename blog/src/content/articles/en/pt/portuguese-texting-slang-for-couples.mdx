## Tips for Texting Your Partner

Start slow and learn the most common abbreviations first. When your partner uses something you do not understand, ask them. They will likely enjoy teaching you their texting style.

Mix formal Portuguese with casual slang to show range. Use full sentences for important conversations and slang for quick daily check-ins. This balance shows both respect and comfort with the language.

Remember that texting styles vary between Brazil and Portugal. Brazilian texts tend to use more abbreviations and informal language. Portuguese texts may be slightly more formal but still use many of the same shortcuts.
