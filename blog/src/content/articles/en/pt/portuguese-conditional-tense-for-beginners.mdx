The conditional tense in Portuguese is your key to sounding more polite, expressing dreams, and discussing what-if scenarios with your partner. It corresponds to "would" in English and is easier to learn than you might think.

## Understanding the Conditional

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Eu gostaria de passar a vida com você"
  translation="I would like to spend my life with you"
  pronunciation="EH-oo gosh-tah-REE-ah deh pah-SAHR ah VEE-dah kon voh-SEH"
  context="A romantic declaration using the conditional to express a heartfelt wish"
/>

The conditional expresses actions that would happen under certain conditions, polite requests, and hypothetical desires. It is formed by adding specific endings to the infinitive form of the verb.

  Using the conditional instead of the present tense makes requests sound much more polite. Compare "Quero água" (I want water) with "Gostaria de água" (I would like water). The conditional shows respect and consideration.
</CultureTip>

## Regular Conditional Formation

The conditional is formed by adding these endings to the infinitive: -ia, -ia, -íamos, -iam.
