Learning Portuguese as an English speaker comes with predictable challenges. Understanding these common mistakes will help you avoid them and sound more natural when speaking with your partner.

## False Friends: Words That Trick You

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Eu estou embaraçada"
  translation="I am pregnant (NOT embarrassed!)"
  pronunciation="EH-oo esh-TOH em-bah-rah-SAH-dah"
  context="This is one of the most famous false friends between Portuguese and English"
/>

<CultureTip
  title="Beware of Cognates"
  flag="🇧🇷"
>
  Many Portuguese words look like English words but have completely different meanings. These false cognates can lead to embarrassing misunderstandings. Always double-check words that seem too similar to English.
</CultureTip>

<VocabCard
  word="Atualmente"
  translation="Currently (NOT actually)"
  pronunciation="ah-too-ahl-MEN-chee"
  example="Atualmente, moro em Lisboa. (Currently, I live in Lisbon.) The word for 'actually' is 'na verdade.'"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Pretender"
  translation="To intend (NOT to pretend)"
  pronunciation="preh-ten-DEHR"
  example="Pretendo viajar amanhã. (I intend to travel tomorrow.) The word for 'to pretend' is 'fingir.'"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Puxar"
  translation="To pull (NOT to push)"
  pronunciation="poo-SHAHR"
  example="Puxe a porta. (Pull the door.) The word for 'to push' is 'empurrar.'"
/>

## Gender Agreement Errors

<CultureTip
  title="Everything Has a Gender"
  flag="🇵🇹"
>
  Unlike English, every Portuguese noun is either masculine or feminine. This affects articles, adjectives, and pronouns. Getting this right is essential for sounding natural.
</CultureTip>

<VocabCard
  word="A problema (incorrect)"
  translation="The problem"
  pronunciation="oo proh-BLEH-mah"
  example="Correct form: O problema é sério. (The problem is serious.) Despite ending in 'a', problema is masculine."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="O mapa"
  translation="The map"
  pronunciation="oo MAH-pah"
  example="O mapa está na mesa. (The map is on the table.) Words ending in 'a' from Greek origin are often masculine."
/>

## Ser vs Estar Confusion

This is perhaps the biggest challenge for English speakers since both verbs translate to "to be."

<ConjugationTable
  verb="ser"
  meaning="to be (permanent characteristics)"
  conjugations={[
    { person: "eu", word: "sou" },
    { person: "você/ele/ela", word: "é" },
    { person: "nós", word: "somos" },
    { person: "vocês/eles/elas", word: "são" }
  ]}
/>

<ConjugationTable
  verb="estar"
  meaning="to be (temporary states, locations)"
  conjugations={[
    { person: "eu", word: "estou" },
    { person: "você/ele/ela", word: "está" },
    { person: "nós", word: "estamos" },
    { person: "vocês/eles/elas", word: "estão" }
  ]}
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Eu sou feliz vs Eu estou feliz"
  translation="I am a happy person vs I am happy right now"
  pronunciation="EH-oo soh feh-LEEZ / EH-oo esh-TOH feh-LEEZ"
  example="Sou feliz means happiness is part of your personality. Estou feliz means you are currently experiencing happiness."
/>

## Pronunciation Pitfalls

<VocabCard
  word="Avô vs Avó"
  translation="Grandfather vs Grandmother"
  pronunciation="ah-VOH (closed o) vs ah-VAW (open o)"
  example="Meu avô é italiano. Minha avó é portuguesa. (My grandfather is Italian. My grandmother is Portuguese.)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Ão ending"
  translation="Nasal sound unique to Portuguese"
  pronunciation="OW with nasal resonance"
  example="Coração, mão, não. The 'ão' is nasal and does not exist in English. Practice humming while saying 'ow.'"
/>

## Word Order Mistakes

<VocabCard
  word="Eu não sei (NOT Eu sei não)"
  translation="I do not know"
  pronunciation="EH-oo now SEH-ee"
  example="Correct: Eu não sei onde está. The negation 'não' comes before the verb in Portuguese."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="O que você quer? (NOT Que você quer?)"
  translation="What do you want?"
  pronunciation="oo kee voh-SEH kehr"
  example="In questions with 'what,' Portuguese uses 'o que' not just 'que' at the start."
/>

## Missing Preposition Contractions

<CultureTip
  title="Contractions Are Mandatory"
  flag="🇧🇷"
>
  In Portuguese, when certain prepositions meet articles, they must contract. Saying them separately sounds unnatural and incorrect.
</CultureTip>

<VocabCard
  word="No, na, nos, nas"
  translation="In the (em + o/a/os/as)"
  pronunciation="noo, nah, nohs, nahz"
  example="Estou na casa. Not 'Estou em a casa.' (I am in the house.)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Do, da, dos, das"
  translation="Of the / From the (de + o/a/os/as)"
  pronunciation="doo, dah, dohs, dahz"
  example="Venho do Brasil. Not 'Venho de o Brasil.' (I come from Brazil.)"
/>

## Practice and Patience

Making mistakes is a natural part of learning. The key is to recognize these patterns and practice the correct forms. Your Portuguese partner can be your best teacher. Ask them to gently correct you when you make these common errors.
