Good pronunciation is the key to being understood in Portuguese—and to understanding your partner when they speak naturally. This guide covers everything you need to know to sound more confident and authentic in Portuguese.

## The Portuguese Alphabet: Getting Started

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Como se pronuncia?"
  translation="How do you pronounce it?"
  pronunciation="KOH-moo see proh-NOON-see-ah"
  context="Ask your partner this whenever you encounter a new word!"
/>

The Portuguese alphabet has 26 letters, the same as English. However, many letters are pronounced differently, and Portuguese has sounds that don't exist in English at all.

## Vowels: The Heart of Portuguese

Portuguese vowels are more complex than English ones, especially because of nasal sounds.

### Open Vowels

<VocabCard
  word="A"
  translation="like 'a' in 'father'"
  pronunciation="ah"
  example="Amor (love) - ah-MOR"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="E (open)"
  translation="like 'e' in 'bed'"
  pronunciation="eh"
  example="Café (coffee) - kah-FEH"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="O (open)"
  translation="like 'o' in 'hot'"
  pronunciation="oh"
  example="Avó (grandmother) - ah-VOH"
/>

### Closed Vowels

<VocabCard
  word="E (closed)"
  translation="like 'e' in 'they' (without the y)"
  pronunciation="ay"
  example="Mesa (table) - MAY-zah"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="O (closed)"
  translation="like 'o' in 'go' (without the w)"
  pronunciation="oh"
  example="Avô (grandfather) - ah-VOH"
/>

<CultureTip
  title="Accent Marks Tell the Story"
  flag="🇵🇹"
>
  Portuguese accent marks aren't decorative—they tell you exactly how to pronounce a word. "Avó" (grandmother) has an open 'o', while "avô" (grandfather) has a closed 'o'. The marks are your pronunciation guides!
</CultureTip>

## Nasal Vowels: The Portuguese Signature Sound

This is what makes Portuguese sound so distinctive. Nasal vowels are produced by letting air flow through both your mouth and nose.

<VocabCard
  word="Ã / ÃO"
  translation="nasal 'a' - air through nose"
  pronunciation="ahng (soft ng)"
  example="Pão (bread) - POWNG"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Ão"
  translation="nasal 'ow' sound"
  pronunciation="owng"
  example="Coração (heart) - koh-rah-SOWNG"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Ões"
  translation="nasal 'oy' sound"
  pronunciation="oysh"
  example="Corações (hearts) - koh-rah-SOYSH"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Ãe"
  translation="nasal 'ay' sound"
  pronunciation="ayng"
  example="Mãe (mother) - MAYNG"
/>

### How to Practice Nasal Sounds

1. Say "song" and notice how the 'ng' resonates in your nose
2. Now try to make that nasal quality on a vowel without the 'g' sound
3. Practice with "pão" (bread)—start with "pow" then add nasality

<CultureTip
  title="The Nasal Trick"
  flag="🇵🇹"
>
  Pinch your nose while saying a nasal vowel—you should feel vibration and resistance. If the sound comes out the same as without pinching, you're not nasalizing enough!
</CultureTip>

## Consonants: Key Differences from English

### The Letter R

Portuguese 'R' is famously tricky because it has multiple sounds:

<VocabCard
  word="R (beginning/double)"
  translation="like 'h' in 'hot' (Brazil) or guttural (Portugal)"
  pronunciation="varies"
  example="Rua (street) - HOO-ah (Brazil), RROO-ah (Portugal)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="R (between vowels)"
  translation="soft, tapped 'r' like Spanish"
  pronunciation="light tap"
  example="Caro (expensive) - KAH-roo"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="R (end of word)"
  translation="often silent or very soft in Brazil"
  pronunciation="varies"
  example="Amor (love) - ah-MOR or ah-MOH"
/>

### The Letter S

<VocabCard
  word="S (beginning)"
  translation="like English 's'"
  pronunciation="ss"
  example="Sol (sun) - SOHL"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="S (between vowels)"
  translation="like 'z'"
  pronunciation="z"
  example="Casa (house) - KAH-zah"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="S (end of syllable)"
  translation="'sh' in Rio/Portugal, 's' elsewhere"
  pronunciation="sh or s"
  example="Festa (party) - FESH-tah (Rio)"
/>

### Letters That Change Sound

<VocabCard
  word="D before i"
  translation="like 'j' in 'jeans' (Brazil)"
  pronunciation="jee"
  example="Dia (day) - JEE-ah"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="T before i"
  translation="like 'ch' in 'cheese' (Brazil)"
  pronunciation="chee"
  example="Noite (night) - NOY-chee"
/>

<CultureTip
  title="Regional Variations"
  flag="🇵🇹"
>
  The D→J and T→CH changes are Brazilian. In Portugal, D and T keep their original sounds. Ask your partner which variety they speak so you can match their pronunciation!
</CultureTip>

## Brazilian vs European Portuguese Pronunciation

The differences are significant enough that learners should be aware:

| Feature | Brazilian | European |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Vowels | More open, clearer | More reduced, "swallowed" |
| R sound | 'H' sound (initial/double) | Guttural or trilled |
| Unstressed E | Sounds like 'ee' | Often silent |
| De/Te | "Jee/Chee" before 'i' | "De/Te" (unchanged) |
| Overall tempo | Slower, melodic | Faster, compact |

### Brazilian Example

<VocabCard
  word="Muito obrigado"
  translation="Thank you very much"
  pronunciation="MOON-too oh-bree-GAH-doo"
  example="Said with clear vowels and 'too' ending"
/>

### European Example

<VocabCard
  word="Muito obrigado"
  translation="Thank you very much"
  pronunciation="MWEENT oh-bree-GAH-doo"
  example="Said with reduced vowels and clipped ending"
/>

## The Letters LH and NH

These combinations create sounds that don't exist as written in English:

<VocabCard
  word="LH"
  translation="like 'lli' in 'million'"
  pronunciation="ly"
  example="Filho (son) - FEE-lyoo"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="NH"
  translation="like 'ny' in 'canyon'"
  pronunciation="ny"
  example="Amanhã (tomorrow) - ah-mah-NYAH"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Trabalho"
  translation="Work"
  pronunciation="trah-BAH-lyoo"
  example="O trabalho é difícil. (The work is difficult.)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Minha"
  translation="My (feminine)"
  pronunciation="MEE-nyah"
  example="Minha casa é sua casa. (My house is your house.)"
/>

## Stress Patterns: Where to Put the Emphasis

Portuguese words follow predictable stress patterns:

1. **Words ending in -a, -e, -o, -am, -em**: Stress the second-to-last syllable
2. **Words ending in -i, -u, or consonants**: Stress the last syllable
3. **Words with accent marks**: Stress falls on the accented syllable

<VocabCard
  word="Casa"
  translation="House"
  pronunciation="KAH-zah (stress: KA)"
  example="Stress on the first syllable"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Aqui"
  translation="Here"
  pronunciation="ah-KEE (stress: KI)"
  example="Stress on the last syllable"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Música"
  translation="Music"
  pronunciation="MOO-zee-kah (stress: MU)"
  example="Accent mark shows where stress falls"
/>

## Common Pronunciation Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Pronouncing final E like English

<VocabCard
  word="Leite"
  translation="Milk"
  pronunciation="LAY-chee (not 'lay-tee')"
  example="In Brazil, final 'e' often sounds like 'ee'"
/>

### 2. Using English R

<VocabCard
  word="Rio"
  translation="River / Rio (city)"
  pronunciation="HEE-oo (not 'ree-oh')"
  example="Initial R is an 'H' sound in Brazil"
/>

### 3. Forgetting nasalization

<VocabCard
  word="Sim"
  translation="Yes"
  pronunciation="seeng (nasal)"
  example="The final 'M' makes the vowel nasal"
/>

## Practice Words for Couples

<VocabCard
  word="Beijo"
  translation="Kiss"
  pronunciation="BAY-zhoo"
  example="Me dá um beijo? (Give me a kiss?)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Abraço"
  translation="Hug"
  pronunciation="ah-BRAH-soo"
  example="Vem cá, quero um abraço. (Come here, I want a hug.)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Juntos"
  translation="Together"
  pronunciation="ZHOON-toosh"
  example="Sempre juntos. (Always together.)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Saudade"
  translation="Longing/Missing"
  pronunciation="sow-DAH-jee"
  example="Que saudade de você! (How I miss you!)"
/>

<CultureTip
  title="Saudade: The Untranslatable Word"
  flag="🇵🇹"
>
  "Saudade" is considered one of the hardest words to translate. It's a deep emotional longing for someone or something you love but are separated from. Perfect pronunciation of this word will impress any Portuguese speaker!
</CultureTip>

3. **Listen to Portuguese music** and sing along
