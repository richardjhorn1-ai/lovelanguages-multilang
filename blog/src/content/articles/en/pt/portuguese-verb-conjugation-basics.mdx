Portuguese verb conjugation might seem intimidating at first, but understanding the patterns makes it manageable. Portuguese verbs follow predictable rules based on their infinitive endings. Once you learn these patterns, you can conjugate thousands of verbs.

## The Three Verb Groups

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Falar, comer, partir"
  translation="To speak, to eat, to leave"
  pronunciation="fah-LAHR, koh-MEHR, pahr-CHEER"
  context="These represent the three verb groups: -AR, -ER, and -IR verbs"
/>

Portuguese verbs are categorized by their infinitive endings. The -AR group is the largest and most common. Understanding each group's conjugation pattern is essential for speaking Portuguese fluently.

## Tips for Mastering Conjugation

Practice with your partner by describing your daily routines. Use phrases like "Eu trabalho" (I work), "Nós comemos" (We eat), and "Você estuda" (You study). The more you use these forms in conversation, the more natural they become.

Focus on the most common verbs first. You will use ser, estar, ter, and ir in almost every conversation. Master these four before moving on to less frequent verbs.
