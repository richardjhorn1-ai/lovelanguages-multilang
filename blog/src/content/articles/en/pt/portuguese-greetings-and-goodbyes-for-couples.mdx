</CultureTip>

## Creating Your Greeting Rituals

The best way to use these greetings is to make them part of your daily routine with your partner:

- **Morning text**: "Bom dia, sol da minha vida!"
- **When you get home**: "Cheguei! Que saudade!"
- **Before bed**: "Boa noite, amor. Sonha comigo."
- **Leaving for work**: "Até logo, meu bem. Te amo!"

Your partner will treasure these small moments of Portuguese affection throughout the day.
