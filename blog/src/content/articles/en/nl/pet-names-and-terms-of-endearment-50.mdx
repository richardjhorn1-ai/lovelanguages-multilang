### Start with the Basics
Begin with universally loved terms like "schatje" or "liefje." These are safe choices that work in almost any situation, from good morning texts to whispered goodnights. As you grow more comfortable, experiment with more unique options that match your partner's personality.

### Match the Mood
Use playful names like "aapje" (little monkey) during fun, relaxed moments. Save deeper terms like "hartje" (little heart) or "leven" (life) for intimate conversations. Food-inspired names work perfectly during cozy moments at home or when sharing meals together.
