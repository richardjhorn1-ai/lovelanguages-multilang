Meeting your Dutch partner's family for the first time? Those first impressions matter, especially when there's a language barrier. Whether you're visiting for Sunday dinner or celebrating a special occasion, having the right Dutch phrases will help you connect with your loved one's family and show them how much you care about their culture. This guide will give you the confidence to navigate those important first conversations and maybe even earn some brownie points with the future in-laws.

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Aangenaam"
  english="Nice to meet you"
  pronunciation="AHN-heh-nahm"
  context="The perfect phrase when shaking hands with each family member for the first time."

## Before You Meet: Essential Preparation

Before walking through that door, here are a few things every couple should discuss:

Your partner can help you understand the family dynamics - who to greet first, what topics to avoid, and whether to bring a small gift. Dutch families are generally quite direct and appreciate authenticity, so your effort to speak their language will mean the world to them.

<VocabCard
  word="Ik wil u graag voorstellen aan..."
  english="I'd like to introduce you to..."
  pronunciation="ik vil ooh khrahkh voor-STEL-len ahn"
  example="Mijn moeder wil je graag ontmoeten."
/>

<CultureTip flag="🇳🇱" title="Dutch Greeting Customs">
Dutch people typically greet with a handshake and eye contact, sometimes with three kisses on alternating cheeks (right-left-right) among friends and family. Wait for your host to initiate this. Always address elders initially with their formal title and last name unless invited otherwise.
</CultureTip>

## Essential First Meeting Phrases

Here's your survival kit for that crucial first meeting:

## Conversation Starters That Work

Dutch families love discussing their culture, travel, and food. These phrases will help you engage naturally:

<CultureTip flag="🇳🇱" title="Safe Conversation Topics">
