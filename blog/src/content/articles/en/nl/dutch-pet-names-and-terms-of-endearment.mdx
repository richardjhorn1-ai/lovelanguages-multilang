Every language has its own unique way of expressing affection through pet names, and Dutch is no exception. While the Dutch are known for their directness, when it comes to love, they have an incredibly sweet and often adorable collection of terms of endearment.

Whether you're dating someone from the Netherlands, Belgium, or simply want to add some Dutch charm to your relationship, this guide covers all the pet names you need to know.

## The Most Popular: Schat and Schatje

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Schatje"
  translation="Little treasure / Sweetie"
  pronunciation="SKHAH-tyuh"
  context="The most commonly used Dutch pet name - you'll hear couples use this constantly."
/>

**Schat** literally means "treasure," and **schatje** is its diminutive form (little treasure). This is by far the most popular Dutch term of endearment. You'll hear it everywhere - in homes, in public, in texts. It's the Dutch equivalent of "honey" or "sweetheart."

<VocabCard
  word="Schat"
  translation="Treasure / Honey"
  pronunciation="skhaht"
  example="Hoe was je dag, schat?"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Schatje"
  translation="Little treasure / Sweetie"
  pronunciation="SKHAH-tyuh"
  example="Ik heb je gemist, schatje."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Schattebout"
  translation="Treasure bolt (darling)"
  pronunciation="SKHA-tuh-bowt"
  example="Kom hier, schattebout!"
/>

<CultureTip title="The Dutch Love Diminutives" flag="🇳🇱">
Dutch speakers love adding "-je" to the end of words to make them smaller and cuter. This isn't just for pet names - it's a whole linguistic phenomenon. "Schat" becomes "schatje," "lief" becomes "liefje," and even non-romantic words get the treatment. It's one of the most endearing features of the Dutch language!

Dutch couples often use affectionate terms related to the heart and physical closeness:

## Animal-Inspired Pet Names

Like many languages, Dutch uses animal names as terms of endearment. These are especially cute and playful:

<VocabCard

  translation="Kitty / Pussycat"
  pronunciation="POO-syuh"
  example="Hoe gaat het met mijn poesje?"

/>

<VocabCard
  word="Duifje"

  pronunciation="DOWF-yuh"
  example="Mijn lieve duifje."
/>

| Dutch | English | Best For |

| Beertje | Little bear | Cuddly partners |
| Duifje | Little dove | Romantic moments |

| Bijtje | Little bee | Busy, energetic partners |

<CultureTip title="When to Use Animal Names" flag="🇳🇱">
Animal-based pet names are quite common in Dutch but tend to be used in more playful, intimate moments rather than in public. They're perfect for texting, private conversations, and cozy moments at home. In public, most Dutch couples stick to "schat" or "lief."

## Sweet Food-Based Terms

Food-related pet names might seem unusual, but they're surprisingly sweet in Dutch:

<VocabCard
  word="Dropje"
  translation="Little licorice (sweetheart)"
  pronunciation="DROP-yuh"
  example="Hoi dropje, wat eten we vanavond?"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Taartje"
  translation="Little tart/pie (sweetie)"
  pronunciation="TAR-tyuh"
  example="Mijn zoete taartje."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Snoepje"
  translation="Little candy / Sweetie"
  pronunciation="SNOOP-yuh"
  example="Kom hier, snoepje."
/>

> **Fun fact:** "Dropje" refers to Dutch licorice (drop), which the Netherlands is famous for. Calling someone your "dropje" is uniquely Dutch!

## Nature and Light-Inspired Terms

These poetic pet names draw from nature and add a romantic touch:

<VocabCard
  word="Zonnetje"
  translation="Little sunshine"
  pronunciation="ZON-uh-tyuh"
  example="Goedemorgen, zonnetje van me."
/>

  pronunciation="SKHONE-tyuh"

## Unique Dutch Pet Names

Some Dutch terms of endearment don't have direct English equivalents:

<VocabCard
  word="Bolleke"
  translation="Little round one (cutie)"
  pronunciation="BOL-uh-kuh"
  example="Mijn lieve bolleke."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Snoes"

/>

<VocabCard
  word="Scheet"
  translation="Little fart (cheeky term)"
  pronunciation="skhate"
  example="Hé scheet, kom je eten?"
/>

<CultureTip title="Playfully Rude Pet Names" flag="🇳🇱">
Don't be alarmed if your Dutch partner calls you "scheet" (fart) or something similar! Dutch culture embraces a certain playful rudeness between close partners. These terms are used with deep affection and show you're comfortable enough to tease each other. It's a sign of intimacy, not an insult!
</CultureTip>
