## Before You Arrive: Russian Family Culture Essentials

Meeting a Russian family is like stepping into a world where hospitality reigns supreme.

But knowing a few cultural basics will make your first meeting smoother than a perfectly brewed cup of Russian tea.

## Essential Greetings and Introductions

First impressions start at the door. These phrases will help you greet everyone with confidence:

| Russian | Pronunciation | English | When to Use |
|---------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Здравствуйте** | ZDRA-stvooy-tyeh | Hello (formal) | Meeting parents, elders |
| **Привет** | pree-VYET | Hi (informal) | Younger siblings, cousins |

## Making Conversation: Family-Friendly Topics

Once the ice is broken, you'll want to keep conversations flowing. Russian families love talking about their culture, food, and of course – their child who brought you home!

### Questions That Show Interest

- **Как вы познакомились?** (kahk vih pahz-nah-KOH-mee-lees') - "How did you two meet?" [Be ready to tell your love story!]

<CultureTip flag="🇷🇺" title="Food is Love">
Russian mothers express love through food. If they offer you something to eat, accepting shows respect for their hospitality. Saying "Я уже сыт/сыта" (yah OO-zheh sih't/sih-tah) - "I'm already full" - is better than refusing outright if you're genuinely not hungry.
