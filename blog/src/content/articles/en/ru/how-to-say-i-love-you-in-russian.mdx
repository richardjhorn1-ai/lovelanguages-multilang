</CultureTip>

## Adding Pet Names

When saying "I love you," it's beautiful to add a term of endearment:

| Russian | English | Pronunciation |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| любимый/любимая | beloved (m/f) | lyu-BI-my / lyu-BI-ma-ya |
| дорогой/дорогая | dear (m/f) | da-ra-GOY / da-ra-GA-ya |
| милый/милая | dear, sweet (m/f) | MI-ly / MI-la-ya |
| солнышко | little sun | SOL-nysh-ka |
| зайчик | little bunny | ZAY-chik |

> **Pro tip:** Combine them! "Я тебя люблю, солнышко" (I love you, my little sun) sounds perfectly natural and incredibly sweet.

## Saying "I Fell in Love With You"

To express when love began:

<VocabCard
  word="Я влюбился в тебя"
  translation="I fell in love with you (male speaker)"
  pronunciation="Ya vlyu-BIL-sya v teh-BYA"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Я влюбилась в тебя"
  translation="I fell in love with you (female speaker)"
  pronunciation="Ya vlyu-BI-las v teh-BYA"
/>

<CultureTip title="Gender Matters" flag="🇷🇺">
Russian verbs change based on the speaker's gender in past tense. Men say "влюбился" while women say "влюбилась." Your partner will appreciate you using the correct form!
</CultureTip>

## Practice Makes Perfect

The best way to learn these phrases is to use them. Start with **Я тебя люблю** and say it when you truly feel it. Your partner will appreciate the effort, even if your pronunciation isn't perfect.

Remember: in Russian culture, the emotion and sincerity behind your words matter more than perfect grammar. When you learn to say "I love you" in their language, you're demonstrating that your love is worth the effort.
