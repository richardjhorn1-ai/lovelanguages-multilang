Russian pronunciation might seem intimidating at first, but here's a secret: it's actually more consistent than English. Once you learn the rules, you can pronounce almost any word correctly. Let's master Russian sounds together!

## The Cyrillic Alphabet: Your Foundation

<PhraseOfDay
  word="А Б В Г Д Е Ё Ж З И Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Я"
  translation="The 33 letters of Russian"
  pronunciation="Each has one primary sound"
  context="Unlike English, Russian letters are pronounced consistently. Learn them once, read anything!"
/>

## Letters That Look Familiar

These letters look like English and sound similar:

<VocabCard
  word="А а"
  translation="Like 'a' in 'father'"
  pronunciation="ah"
  example="Анна (Anna), мама (mama)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="О о"
  translation="Like 'o' in 'more' (when stressed)"
  pronunciation="oh"
  example="Он (he), кот (cat)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Т т"
  translation="Like 't' in 'stop'"
  pronunciation="t"
  example="Там (there), ты (you)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="М м"
  translation="Like 'm' in 'mother'"
  pronunciation="m"
  example="Мама (mom), мы (we)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="К к"
  translation="Like 'k' in 'sky'"
  pronunciation="k"
  example="Как (how), кто (who)"
/>

## False Friends: Letters That Look Familiar But Sound Different

These are the tricky ones - they look like English letters but sound completely different:

<VocabCard
  word="В в"
  translation="Sounds like English 'v'"
  pronunciation="v (not b!)"
  example="Вода (water) - 'va-DA'"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Н н"
  translation="Sounds like English 'n'"
  pronunciation="n (not h!)"
  example="Нет (no) - 'nyet'"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Р р"
  translation="Rolled 'r' sound"
  pronunciation="r (not p!)"
  example="Россия (Russia) - 'ra-SI-ya'"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="С с"
  translation="Sounds like English 's'"
  pronunciation="s (not c!)"
  example="Спасибо (thank you) - 'spa-SI-ba'"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Х х"
  translation="Like 'ch' in Scottish 'loch'"
  pronunciation="kh (not h!)"
  example="Хорошо (good) - 'kha-ra-SHO'"
/>

<CultureTip title="The Russian R" flag="🇷🇺">
The Russian Р is rolled, like a Spanish R. Don't worry if you can't roll it perfectly at first - your partner will understand you, and it comes with practice. Many learners master it within a few months.
</CultureTip>

## Uniquely Russian Letters

These letters don't exist in English:

### The "Hard" Sounds

<VocabCard
  word="Ы ы"
  translation="A deep 'i' sound from the throat"
  pronunciation="Like 'i' in 'bit' but further back"
  example="Ты (you), сын (son), мы (we)"
/>

**Practice tip:** Say "ee" but push your tongue back and down. It's like getting punched in the stomach while saying "ee"!

<VocabCard
  word="Ж ж"
  translation="Like 's' in 'pleasure' or 'treasure'"
  pronunciation="zh"
  example="Жена (wife), можно (can/may)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Ш ш"
  translation="Like 'sh' in 'shoe'"
  pronunciation="sh"
  example="Хорошо (good), ваш (your)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Щ щ"
  translation="Like 'sh' but softer and longer"
  pronunciation="shch"
  example="Ещё (more/still), борщ (borscht)"
/>

### The Vowel Shifters

<VocabCard
  word="Ё ё"
  translation="Like 'yo' in 'yonder'"
  pronunciation="yo"
  example="Её (her), ёлка (Christmas tree)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Ю ю"
  translation="Like 'you'"
  pronunciation="yu"
  example="Люблю (I love), юг (south)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Я я"
  translation="Like 'ya' in 'yard'"
  pronunciation="ya"
  example="Я (I), моя (my - feminine)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Э э"
  translation="Like 'e' in 'set'"
  pronunciation="eh"
  example="Это (this), эхо (echo)"
/>

### The Modifiers

<VocabCard
  word="Ь ь (soft sign)"
  translation="Softens the previous consonant"
  pronunciation="(silent - makes letters 'soft')"
  example="Любовь (love) - the 'в' is softened"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Ъ ъ (hard sign)"
  translation="Keeps consonant hard before soft vowels"
  pronunciation="(silent - rare)"
  example="Объяснить (to explain)"
/>

<CultureTip title="Soft vs Hard Consonants" flag="🇷🇺">
Every Russian consonant can be "hard" or "soft." Soft consonants are pronounced with your tongue touching the roof of your mouth, like adding a tiny "y" sound. This is one of Russian's most distinctive features.
</CultureTip>

## Stress and Vowel Reduction

Russian stress (emphasis) is crucial and affects pronunciation:

### Stressed O vs Unstressed O

<VocabCard
  word="Молоко"
  translation="Milk"
  pronunciation="ma-la-KO (not mo-lo-ko!)"
  example="Unstressed O sounds like A"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Хорошо"
  translation="Good/Okay"
  pronunciation="kha-ra-SHO"
  example="Only the stressed O sounds like 'o'"
/>

### The Rule

- **Stressed О** = clear "oh" sound
- **Unstressed О** = reduced to "ah" sound

<VocabCard
  word="Она"
  translation="She"
  pronunciation="a-NA (not o-na)"
  example="First O is unstressed, so it sounds like A"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Он"
  translation="He"
  pronunciation="on"
  example="Single-syllable words: O stays as O"
/>

## Voicing and Devoicing

Russian consonants change at the end of words and before other consonants:

### Final Consonant Devoicing

Voiced consonants become voiceless at the end of words:

| Written | Pronounced | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Б → П | b → p | Хлеб (bread) = "khlyep" |
| В → Ф | v → f | Любовь (love) = "lyu-BOF" |
| Г → К | g → k | Друг (friend) = "druk" |
| Д → Т | d → t | Год (year) = "got" |
| Ж → Ш | zh → sh | Муж (husband) = "mush" |
| З → С | z → s | Раз (time) = "ras" |

<VocabCard
  word="Муж"
  translation="Husband"
  pronunciation="mush (not muzh)"
  example="Final Ж becomes Ш"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Любовь"
  translation="Love"
  pronunciation="lyu-BOF (not lyu-bov)"
  example="Final В becomes Ф"
/>

## Common Pronunciation Challenges

### The Ы Sound

This is often the hardest for English speakers:

<VocabCard
  word="Ты"
  translation="You (informal)"
  pronunciation="ty (with the 'y' from your throat)"
  example="Practice: Start with 'tea' but drop your tongue back"
/>

**Practice phrase:**
<VocabCard
  word="Ты и я"
  translation="You and I"
  pronunciation="ty ee ya"
  example="Notice the difference between Ы and И"
/>

### The Rolled Р

<VocabCard
  word="Россия"
  translation="Russia"
  pronunciation="ra-SI-ya"
  example="The Р is rolled - tip of tongue vibrates"
/>

**Practice:** Start by saying "butter" quickly. That quick "tt" uses similar tongue movement.

### Ш vs Щ

<VocabCard
  word="Ш - short 'sh'"
  translation="Like English 'sh' in 'ship'"
  pronunciation="sh"
  example="Шапка (hat) - SHAP-ka"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Щ - long, soft 'sh'"
  translation="Like 'sh' + 'ch' blended, held longer"
  pronunciation="shch"
  example="Ещё (still/more) - ye-SHCHO"
/>

<CultureTip title="Don't Stress About Stress" flag="🇷🇺">
Russian word stress is unpredictable and must be memorized for each word. Don't worry - even if you stress the wrong syllable, you'll usually be understood. With practice, common patterns emerge.
</CultureTip>

## Pronunciation Rules Summary

### Always True

1. **Stressed О** = "oh"
2. **Unstressed О** = "ah"
3. **Е** = "ye" (or "e" after ч, ш, ж, щ)
4. **Final voiced consonants** become voiceless
5. **Ь** (soft sign) softens the preceding consonant

### Practice Words

  word="Привет"
  translation="Hello"
  pronunciation="pri-VYET"
  example="Stressed on second syllable"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Спасибо"
  translation="Thank you"
