Learning the Cyrillic alphabet is your first step to reading Russian with your partner. While it might look intimidating at first, many letters are similar to English, and with practice, you'll be reading love notes in no time!

## Why Learn Cyrillic Together?

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Я читаю по-русски"
  translation="I read in Russian"
  pronunciation="Ya chi-TA-yu pa-RUS-ki"
  context="Your first milestone! Being able to read Russian opens up a world of communication with your partner."
/>

Learning Cyrillic as a couple makes the process more fun and keeps you both accountable. You can quiz each other, read signs together, and decode your partner's text messages!

## The 33 Russian Letters

The Russian alphabet has 33 letters. Let's break them into friendly groups based on how familiar they'll feel to English speakers.

### Letters That Look AND Sound Like English

These are your instant wins - they look familiar and sound similar:

| Cyrillic | Sound | Example Word |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| А а | "a" as in "father" | Анна (Anna) |
| Е е | "ye" as in "yes" | Ева (Eva) |
| К к | "k" as in "kite" | кот (cat) |
| М м | "m" as in "mom" | мама (mom) |
| О о | "o" as in "or" | он (he) |
| Т т | "t" as in "top" | там (there) |

<CultureTip title="The Unstressed O" flag="🇷🇺">
When "О" is not stressed in a word, it sounds more like "a". So "Москва" (Moscow) is pronounced "mask-VA" not "mosk-VA". This vowel reduction is key to sounding natural!
</CultureTip>

### False Friends - They Look English But Sound Different

Watch out for these tricksters!

| Cyrillic | Sound | NOT Like |
|----------|-------|----------|
| В в | "v" as in "very" | Not "B"! |
| Н н | "n" as in "no" | Not "H"! |
| Р р | rolled "r" | Not "P"! |
| С с | "s" as in "sun" | Not "C"! |
| У у | "oo" as in "moon" | Not "Y"! |
| Х х | "kh" like Scottish "loch" | Not "X"! |

<VocabCard
  word="Россия"
  translation="Russia"
  pronunciation="ra-SI-ya"
  example="Remember: Р sounds like 'r', not 'p'!"
/>

### Unique Cyrillic Letters

These letters have no English equivalent in appearance:

| Cyrillic | Sound | Memory Tip |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Б б | "b" as in "boy" | Looks like a "6" with a bump |
| Г г | "g" as in "go" | Like an upside-down "L" |
| Д д | "d" as in "dog" | Like a little house |
| Ж ж | "zh" like "pleasure" | Looks like a bug |
| З з | "z" as in "zoo" | Like the number "3" |
| И и | "ee" as in "feet" | Backwards "N" |
| Й й | short "y" sound | "И" with a hat |
| Л л | "l" as in "love" | Like a tent |
| П п | "p" as in "pet" | Like a doorway |
| Ф ф | "f" as in "fun" | Like a person with arms out |
| Ц ц | "ts" as in "cats" | Has a little tail |
| Ч ч | "ch" as in "church" | Like a chair |
| Ш ш | "sh" as in "ship" | Three bumps on top |
| Щ щ | soft "shch" | "Ш" with a tail |
| Ы ы | deep "i" sound | No English equivalent |
| Э э | "e" as in "bet" | Backwards "E" |
| Ю ю | "yu" as in "you" | Looks like "IO" combined |
| Я я | "ya" as in "yard" | Backwards "R" |

<CultureTip title="The Mysterious Ы" flag="🇷🇺">
The letter "Ы" produces a sound that doesn't exist in English. Try saying "ee" while pulling your tongue back slightly. Your Russian partner will love helping you practice this unique sound!
</CultureTip>

### The Silent Helpers

These two letters don't make sounds on their own but modify other letters:

| Cyrillic | Name | Function |
|----------|------|----------|
| Ь | Soft sign | Makes the preceding consonant soft/palatalized |
| Ъ | Hard sign | Creates a brief pause, keeps consonant hard |

  translation="Love"
  pronunciation="lyu-BOF"
  example="The soft sign (ь) makes the final 'в' soft."

<CultureTip title="Cursive Russian" flag="🇷🇺">
Russians primarily write in cursive, which looks quite different from printed Cyrillic. Once you master the printed alphabet, consider learning cursive together - it's essential for reading handwritten notes from your partner!
</CultureTip>

## Reading Your First Love Note

Put it all together! Try reading this short love note:

**Привет, солнышко!**

**Я тебя люблю. Ты красивая. Обнимаю тебя.**

**Твой (name)**

Translation: "Hi, sunshine! I love you. You are beautiful. I hug you. Yours, (name)"

## Tips for Couples Learning Cyrillic

1. **Make flashcards together** - Write letters on cards and quiz each other
2. **Label items at home** - Put Russian labels on household objects
3. **Text in Cyrillic** - Send simple messages to practice
4. **Read signs aloud** - When you see Russian text, try to sound it out
5. **Celebrate small wins** - Each letter mastered is progress!

<VocabCard
  word="Молодец!"
  translation="Well done!"
  pronunciation="ma-la-DYETS"
  example="Say this to your partner when they read something correctly!"

## Common Letter Combinations

These combinations appear frequently and are worth memorizing:

| ТС | "ts" | улыбаться (to smile) |
| СЬ | soft "s" | любовь (love) |
