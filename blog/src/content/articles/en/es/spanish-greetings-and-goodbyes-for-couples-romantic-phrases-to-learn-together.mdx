## Conjugating Common Greeting Verbs

Master these essential verbs to create personalized greetings:

<ConjugationTable
  verb="Estar"
  meaning="To be (temporary state)"
  conjugations={[
    { person: "Yo", word: "estoy", translation: "I am" },
    { person: "Tú", word: "estás", translation: "You are" },
    { person: "Él/Ella", word: "está", translation: "He/She is" },
    { person: "Nosotros", word: "estamos", translation: "We are" }
  ]}

Use **estar** to ask "¿Cómo estás?" (How are you?) - a perfect follow-up to any greeting.

### Evening Return
**Partner A:** "¡Hola! Ya llegué."
**Partner B:** "Buenas noches, corazón. ¿Cómo estuvo tu día?"

- **Argentina:** "¿Cómo andás?" (How are you doing?) - common informal greeting
