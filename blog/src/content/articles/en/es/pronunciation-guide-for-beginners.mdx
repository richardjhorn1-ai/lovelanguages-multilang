Learning Spanish pronunciation with your partner is like learning a beautiful dance together. When you both master the sounds, you'll create magic in every conversation. This guide will help you pronounce Spanish words confidently, so you can [tell your partner "I love you"](/learn/en/es/how-to-say-i-love-you-in-spanish/) with perfect Spanish flair.

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Te quiero"
  translation="I love you (romantic)"
  pronunciation="teh KYEH-roh"
  context="The most romantic phrase - use this pronunciation to melt your partner's heart."
/>

## Why Spanish Pronunciation is Perfect for Couples

Spanish pronunciation is wonderfully consistent - once you learn the rules, you can read any word correctly. Unlike English, Spanish letters make the same sounds every time. This means you and your partner can practice together confidently, knowing you're both saying things right.

The best part? Spanish sounds are romantic and flowing. When you pronounce words correctly, you'll naturally sound more passionate and expressive - perfect for those [romantic phrases you want to share](/learn/en/es/romantic-phrases-for-every-occasion/).

## The Magic Five: Spanish Vowels

Spanish has just five vowel sounds, and they're always pure. Think of them as your foundation for romantic pronunciation:

<VocabCard
  word="Amor"
  translation="Love"
  pronunciation="ah-MOHR"
  example="Mi amor, ¿cómo estás?"
/>

| Letter | Sound | English Similar | Romantic Example |
|--------|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **A** | ah | "father" | **amor** (love) |
| **E** | eh | "bed" | **eres** (you are) |
| **I** | ee | "see" | **mío** (mine) |
| **O** | oh | "go" | **corazón** (heart) |
| **U** | oo | "food" | **tú** (you) |

<CultureTip flag="🇪🇸" title="Pure Vowels Matter">
Spanish vowels are short and crisp - never draw them out like in English. Your "I love you" (Te amo) should sound like "teh AH-moh," not "tay AH-mow."
</CultureTip>

## Consonants That Change Everything

Some Spanish consonants sound different from English, but these differences create that beautiful Spanish rhythm:

### The Rolling R
The famous Spanish **rr** isn't as hard as it seems. Try this with your partner:
- Say "butter" repeatedly, faster and faster
- Notice how your tongue taps the roof of your mouth?
- That's exactly the motion for Spanish **rr**

<VocabCard
  word="Corazón"
  translation="Heart"
  pronunciation="koh-rah-SOHN"
  example="Mi corazón late por ti."
/>

### Soft and Sweet Sounds
- **Ñ** (like "canyon"): **niño** (NEE-nyoh) - "child"
- **LL** (like "million"): **llamar** (yah-MAHR) - "to call"
- **J** (soft h sound): **jamón** (hah-MOHN) - "ham"

## Stress and Rhythm: The Romantic Flow

Spanish words have natural stress that creates their musical rhythm. Here's the simple rule:
- Words ending in vowels, **n**, or **s**: stress the second-to-last syllable
- Words ending in other consonants: stress the last syllable

| Word | Pronunciation | Stress Pattern | Meaning |
|------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| **Hablo** | AH-bloh | HAB-lo | "I speak" |
| **Comer** | koh-MEHR | ko-MER | "to eat" |
| **Cuidad** | koo-ee-DAHD | kui-DAD | "city" |
| **Amor** | ah-MOHR | a-MOR | "love" |
| **Eres** | EH-rehs | E-res | "you are" |

/>

### Essential Romantic Vocabulary

| Spanish | Pronunciation | English | Perfect For |
|---------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Hermoso/a** | ehr-MOH-soh/sah | Beautiful | Compliments |
| **Guapo/a** | GWAH-poh/pah | Handsome/Pretty | Daily praise |
| **Dulce** | DOOL-seh | Sweet | Terms of endearment |
| **Fuerte** | FWEHR-teh | Strong | Supportive moments |
| **Ternura** | tehr-NOO-rah | Tenderness | Expressing affection |
| **Abrazo** | ah-BRAH-soh | Hug | Physical affection |
| **Beso** | BEH-soh | Kiss | Romantic moments |

## Common Pronunciation Mistakes Couples Make

Watch out for these typical English-speaker errors:

1. **The English R**: Don't use the English R in Spanish. Your tongue shouldn't curl back
   - ❌ "AR-moh" (wrong)
   - ✅ "AH-moh" (correct - Te amo)

2. **V as V**: Spanish **v** sounds exactly like **b**
   - ❌ "vey" (wrong)
   - ✅ "beh" (correct - voy)

3. **H is Silent**: Never pronounce Spanish **h**
   - ❌ "hah-blah" (wrong)
   - ✅ "AH-blah" (correct - habla)

4. **Z and C**: In Spain, these sound like "th" in "think"
   - **Corazón**: co-rah-THOHN (Spain) or co-rah-SOHN (Latin America)

<CultureTip flag="🇪🇸" title="Regional Variations">
Spanish pronunciation varies by region. In Spain, **z** and soft **c** sound like "th." In Latin America, they sound like "s." Both are correct - choose what matches your partner's background!
</CultureTip>

Here are five sentences to practice daily with your partner. Focus on perfect pronunciation, not speed:

1. **"Buenos días, mi amor."** (BWEH-nohs DEE-ahs mee ah-MOHR)

3. **"Te extraño mucho."** (teh ehs-TRAH-nyoh MOO-choh)
