<CultureTip title="Inverted Question Marks" flag="🇪🇸">
Spanish uses inverted question marks (¿) at the beginning of questions. This unique feature helps readers know a question is coming, especially useful for long sentences. It's also used in exclamations (¡). When texting informally, many Spanish speakers skip the opening mark.
</CultureTip>

### ¿Por qué? vs ¿Para qué? (Why?)

| Question Word | Usage | Example |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| ¿Por qué? | Reason/Cause | ¿Por qué estás triste? (Why are you sad?) |
| ¿Para qué? | Purpose | ¿Para qué necesitas esto? (What do you need this for?) |

**Remember:** "Porque" (one word, no accent) means "because" in answers.

/>
