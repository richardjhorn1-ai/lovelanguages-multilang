Meeting your Spanish partner's family is an exciting and important milestone. Spanish families are warm, close-knit, and family gatherings are central to their culture. With the right phrases and cultural awareness, you'll win over your partner's parents and extended family.

## The Essential First Greeting

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Encantado/Encantada de conocerles"
  translation="Delighted to meet you (m/f speaker)"
  pronunciation="en-kan-TA-do/en-kan-TA-da de ko-no-THER-les"
  context="The perfect polite greeting when meeting your partner's parents. Use 'usted/ustedes' (formal you) until invited to use 'tú'."
/>

## Greeting with Kisses

In Spain, greetings involve two kisses on the cheeks (right cheek first, then left). This applies to:
- Women greeting anyone
- Men greeting women
- Men often shake hands with other men initially

<VocabCard
  word="¡Hola! Mucho gusto"
  translation="Hello! Nice to meet you"
  pronunciation="O-la! MOO-cho GOO-sto"
  example="¡Hola! Mucho gusto. Soy [your name]."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Es un placer conocerles"
  translation="It's a pleasure to meet you"
  pronunciation="es oon pla-THER ko-no-THER-les"
  example="Es un verdadero placer conocerles por fin."
/>

<CultureTip title="The Two Kisses" flag="🇪🇸">
Don't be surprised by the two-kiss greeting! It's standard in Spain. Start with the right cheek, then the left. If you're uncomfortable, a warm handshake is also acceptable, but the kisses show you're embracing their culture.
</CultureTip>

## Gift-Giving Etiquette

Bringing a gift is appreciated but not obligatory in Spain. Here's what works:

### Appropriate Gifts

| Spanish | English | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Vino** | Wine | A quality bottle, especially from their region |
| **Dulces** | Sweets | Pastries or chocolates |
| **Flores** | Flowers | Nice bouquet (avoid dahlias - associated with funerals) |
| **Algo de mi país** | Something from my country | Local specialties are valued |

<CultureTip title="Wine as a Gift" flag="🇪🇸">
Spain is a wine country! Bringing wine is always appreciated, but be aware they might not open it immediately - they may save it for later. Don't be offended if they serve something else. If you know their region, try to bring wine from elsewhere to show variety!
</CultureTip>

## At the Dinner Table

Spanish meals are long, social affairs. Dinner typically starts late (9-10 PM) and can last hours.

/>

<CultureTip title="The Late Dinner" flag="🇪🇸">
Spanish dinners are LATE by most standards. Don't be surprised if dinner starts at 9 or 10 PM! Eat a snack beforehand if needed. Also, expect sobremesa - the post-meal conversation that can last an hour or more. Don't rush to leave!
</CultureTip>

### Table Manners

| Do This | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Keep hands on the table** | Spanish custom (not in lap) |
| **Engage in conversation** | Meals are social events |
| **Stay for sobremesa** | Post-meal chat is essential |
| **Try everything** | Shows appreciation |

## Family Vocabulary

## Handling Wine and Toasts

Wine is central to Spanish meals. Here's how to participate:

/>

<CultureTip title="Never Empty Your Own Glass" flag="🇪🇸">
In Spain, it's polite to fill others' glasses before your own. If your glass is empty, wait for someone to offer - or simply gesture toward the bottle. Also, never toast with water - it's considered bad luck!
</CultureTip>

  pronunciation="oon pla-THER a-BER-les ko-no-THEE-do"

/>

## Things to Avoid

### Don't:
1. **Rush the meal** - Spanish dinners take hours
2. **Leave right after eating** - Stay for sobremesa
3. **Criticize food** - Even jokingly
4. **Discuss controversial topics** - Politics, Catalonia, etc. on first meeting
5. **Be too reserved** - Warmth is valued

### Do:
1. **Be warm and expressive** - Spanish culture is effusive
2. **Ask about family** - They love talking about relatives
3. **Compliment the food** - Multiple times!
4. **Try speaking Spanish** - They'll adore your effort
5. **Show interest in their region** - Spain is regionally proud

<CultureTip title="Regional Pride" flag="🇪🇸">
Spain has strong regional identities. If your partner's family is from Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia, or Andalusia, show interest in their specific region. Ask about local traditions, food specialties, and maybe learn a phrase in their regional language if applicable!
</CultureTip>

## Sample Conversation

**You:** ¡Hola! Encantado de conocerles.
**Parents:** ¡Hola! Bienvenido/a. Pasa, pasa.
**You:** Les he traído vino.
**Mom:** ¡Ay, qué detalle! Muchas gracias.
**You:** He oído hablar mucho de ustedes.
**Dad:** Siéntate. ¿Qué quieres tomar?
**You:** Lo que ustedes tomen, por favor.

Good luck meeting the family! With warmth, good manners, and a few Spanish phrases, you'll make a wonderful impression.
