## How to Practice Together

Learning greetings and farewells as a couple creates beautiful daily rituals. Start your morning with "Buenos días, mi amor" and end each night with "Que descanses, cariño." These small moments build lasting connection.

Practice by greeting each other in Spanish throughout the day—when you wake up, leave for work, return home, and before sleep. Make it a game: whoever remembers to use Spanish greetings most often wins a romantic favor!

<CultureTip flag="🇪🇸" title="Time-Sensitive Greetings">
Spanish greetings change with the time of day. "Buenos días" becomes "Buenas tardes" after lunch (around 2pm), and switches to "Buenas noches" after sunset. Your partner will notice when you get this right!
