## Before You Arrive: Setting the Stage for Success

## Pro Tips for Making a Great Impression

1. **Bring a small gift**: Flowers for mom, wine for dad, or something from your home country shows thoughtfulness
2. **Learn about regional customs**: Spanish traditions vary greatly by region—ask your partner about local customs
3. **Show interest in family photos**: **"¿Quién es esta persona?"** (kee-EHN ehs EHS-tah pehr-SOH-nah) - "Who is this person?"
4. **Accept food offerings graciously**: Even if you're full, try a small portion
5. **Use terms of endearment appropriately**: **"Mamá"** and **"Papá"** might be used, but wait for your partner's cue

<CultureTip flag="🇪🇸" title="The Long Goodbye">
Spanish goodbyes can take 30+ minutes! Don't rush the *despedida*. Expect multiple rounds of hugs, kisses, and "one more thing" conversations. It's a sign of affection, not inefficiency!
