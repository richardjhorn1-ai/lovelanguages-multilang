Starting your Swedish journey with your partner? Understanding basic grammar helps you express your feelings authentically and avoid awkward moments.

  word="Jag älskar dig"

## Why Swedish Grammar is Actually Friendly

Unlike many languages, Swedish grammar is refreshingly straightforward for couples learning together. No complicated cases like Polish, no verb conjugations for every person like Spanish. Think of Swedish grammar like building with LEGO blocks - simple pieces that fit together logically.

The best part? Once you learn the basic patterns, you can express endless romantic thoughts. From [saying I love you](/learn/en/sv/how-to-say-i-love-you-in-swedish/) to planning your next [date night in Swedish](/learn/en/sv/swedish-date-night-vocabulary-planning-activities/), these foundations unlock everything.

## The Core Pattern: Subject + Verb + Object

This simple formula creates 90% of Swedish sentences you'll use daily:

**Subject** (who's doing it) + **Verb** (what they're doing) + **Object** (who/what receives it)

Let's see this with romantic vocabulary:

<VocabCard
  word="Jag saknar dig"
  english="I miss you"
  pronunciation="yahg SAHK-nahr day"
  example="Use this when you're apart from your partner."
/>

## Swedish Pronouns: Keep It Simple

Unlike many languages, Swedish pronouns stay the same regardless of their role in the sentence:

| Swedish | English | Pronunciation | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Jag** | I | yahg | Talking about yourself |
| **Du** | You (singular) | doo | Addressing your partner |
| **Han** | He | hahn | Talking about him |
| **Hon** | She | hohn | Talking about her |
| **Vi** | We | vee | Talking about you both |
| **Ni** | You (plural) | nee | Addressing couples together |
| **De** | They | deh | Talking about others |

<CultureTip flag="🇸🇪" title="Personal Space in Swedish">
Swedes value personal space and direct communication. Using "du" (you) is perfectly fine with your partner - no formal/informal stress like in other languages!
</CultureTip>

## Present Tense: One Form Fits All

Here's where Swedish gets beautifully simple. In present tense, verbs have ONE form regardless of who's doing the action:

<ConjugationTable
  verb="älskar"
  meaning="to love (present tense)"
  conjugations={[
    { person: "I", polish: "jag älskar", english: "I love" },
    { person: "You", polish: "du älskar", english: "you love" },
    { person: "He/She", polish: "hon/han älskar", english: "she/he loves" },
    { person: "We", polish: "vi älskar", english: "we love" },
    { person: "You (plural)", polish: "ni älskar", english: "you all love" },
    { person: "They", polish: "de älskar", english: "they love" }
  ]}
/>

Notice something magical? The verb **älskar** never changes! Compare this to English where "I love" but "he loves" (with an S). Swedish keeps it consistent.

## Creating Romantic Sentences Together

Now let's build sweet phrases you'll actually use:

| Swedish Phrase | Translation | Pronunciation | Grammar Note |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Jag tycker om dig** | I like you | yahg TI-ker ohm day | Use "tycker om" for liking |
| **Du är vacker** | You're beautiful | doo ehr VAH-ker | Basic adjective placement |
| **Vi har det bra** | We have it good | vee hahr deh brah | Simple present statement |
| **Jag vill kyssa dig** | I want to kiss you | yahg vihl SHEE-sah day | "Vill" = want to |
| **Du gör mig lycklig** | You make me happy | doh yur may LUCK-lee | Cause-effect structure |

<CultureTip flag="🇸🇪" title="Swedish Directness">
Swedes appreciate direct, honest expressions of affection. Saying exactly what you feel is considered genuine and romantic!
</CultureTip>

## Word Order: Questions Made Easy

Asking questions in Swedish is wonderfully logical. Just flip the subject and verb:

**Statement:** Du älskar mig (You love me)
**Question:** Älskar du mig? (Do you love me?)

See? No extra words needed! Here are essential romantic questions:

- **Vill du följa med mig hem?** (veel doh FUHL-yah mehd may hehm) - Do you want to come home with me?
- **Saknar du mig?** (SAHK-nahr doo may) - Do you miss me?
- **Vad tycker du om mig?** (vahd TI-ker doo ohm may) - What do you think of me?

## Common Beginner Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**1. Forgetting "om" with "tycker"**
- ❌ Jag tycker dig (I think you - nonsense!)
- ✅ Jag tycker **om** dig (I like you)

**2. Mixing up "dig" and "du"**
- ❌ Jag älskar **du** (I love you - wrong form)
- ✅ Jag älskar **dig** (I love you - correct object form)

**3. Overthinking word order**
- ❌ Mig du älskar? (Me you love? - sounds like Yoda!)
- ✅ Älskar du mig? (Do you love me? - natural!)

**4. Using English word order for questions**
