| Sunt îndrăgostit/ă de tine | I'm in love with you | Romantic |
| Te vreau | I want you | Passionate |
| Îmi ești drag/ă | You are dear to me | Gentle, warm |

<CultureTip title="Gender Matters" flag="🇷🇴">

## Pet Names to Pair With Your Love

When saying "I love you," adding a pet name makes it even sweeter:

| Romanian | English | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Iubito/Iubitule | My love | Very common, always appropriate |
| Dragostea mea | My love/darling | Romantic |
| Sufletul meu | My soul | Deep, poetic |
| Scumpule/Scumpo | Dear one | Affectionate |
| Puiule/Puișor | Little one | Cute, tender |

> **Pro tip:** Combine them! "Te iubesc, dragostea mea" (I love you, my darling) flows beautifully and is very romantic.

## Morning and Evening Love

Express your love throughout the day:

## Practice Makes Perfect

The best way to learn these phrases is to use them. Start with **te iubesc** and say it when you feel it. Your Romanian partner will appreciate the effort, even if your pronunciation needs work.

Remember: in Romanian, as in all languages, the emotion behind your words matters more than perfect grammar. When you say "I love you" in their language, you're saying "I love you enough to learn how to say this."
