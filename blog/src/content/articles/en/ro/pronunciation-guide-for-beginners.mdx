## Romanian Sounds Made Simple

Romanian pronunciation is actually quite forgiving for English speakers. Unlike some languages, Romanian letters generally make the same sounds consistently. Think of it like learning a romantic code together - once you know the rules, you can read any word!

The key is that Romanian is phonetic - words sound exactly like they're spelled. No silent letters hiding like in English! This makes it perfect for couples to learn together since you can help each other sound out new words.

## The 5 Essential Rules

Here are the fundamental pronunciation rules that will transform how you both sound:

1. **Every letter gets pronounced** - No silent letters in Romanian
2. **Stress usually falls on the second-to-last syllable** - Like "i-UBESC" (love)
3. **C before E/I sounds like CH** - "ce" becomes "cheh", "ci" becomes "chee"
4. **G before E/I sounds like J** - "ge" becomes "jeh", "gi" becomes "jee"
5. **Ă sounds like 'uh'** - This unique Romanian vowel appears in many words

  translation="Dear/Sweetheart"

  example="Dragă, vrei să ieși la cină?"

## Couples' Pronunciation Practice

Practice these relationship words together - they're perfect for testing your new pronunciation skills:

| Romanian | English | Pronunciation | Couple Context |
|----------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **iubit** | boyfriend | yoo-BEET | "El este iubitul meu" (He is my boyfriend) |
| **iubită** | girlfriend | yoo-BEE-tuh | "Ea este iubita mea" (She is my girlfriend) |
| **soț** | husband | sohts | "Soțul meu este..." (My husband is...) |
| **soție** | wife | SOH-tsee-eh | "Soția mea este..." (My wife is...) |
| **dragoste** | love | DRAH-goh-steh | "Te iubesc din toată dragostea mea" (I love you with all my love) |

<CultureTip flag="🇷🇴" title="Romantic Pronunciation">
Romanians appreciate when foreigners make the effort to pronounce words correctly. Your partner will be touched when you practice saying "dragă" (darling) with the proper "ă" sound - it's uniquely Romanian!
</CultureTip>

## Vowels: The Heart of Romanian

Master these vowel sounds and you'll instantly sound more authentic:

**A** - Like "a" in "father" (mama = MAH-mah)
**E** - Like "e" in "bed" (te = teh)
**I** - Like "ee" in "see" (imi = EE-mee)
**O** - Like "o" in "more" (dor = dohr)
**U** - Like "oo" in "moon" (tu = too)
**Ă** - Like "uh" in "duh" (român = roh-MUHN)

  translation="Romanian (person)"
  pronunciation="roh-MUHN"
  example="Eu sunt român/româncă."

## Consonants That Change Everything

Some Romanian consonants behave differently than in English. Here's what to watch for:

**C before A/O/U** = K sound (casă = KAH-suh)
**C before E/I** = CH sound (cer = cher)
**G before A/O/U** = G sound (gust = goost)
**G before E/I** = J sound (ger = jer)
**R** = Rolled or flipped R (practice together!)

Practice tip: Try saying "cer" (heaven) and "ger" (frost) together. The "c" and "g" sounds before "e" are romantic and soft.
