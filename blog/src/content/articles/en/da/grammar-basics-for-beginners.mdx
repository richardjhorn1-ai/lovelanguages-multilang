## Danish Word Order: It's Simpler Than You Think

Danish follows a **Subject-Verb-Object** pattern, just like English. This makes it easier for couples to start building sentences together right away!

**The basic formula:** Subject + Verb + Object = Perfect Danish sentence

- **Jeg** (I) + **elsker** (love) + **dig** (you) = "I love you"
- **Du** (You) + **ser** (look) + **smuk** (beautiful) + **ud** (out) = "You look beautiful"

  word="Jeg"
  translation="I"
  pronunciation="yay"
  example="Jeg savner dig når du ikke er her."

<CultureTip flag="🇩🇰" title="Danish Sentence Flow">
Danes often speak with a melodic rhythm. When asking questions, they simply flip the subject and verb: "Du elsker mig" (You love me) becomes "Elsker du mig?" (Do you love me?). No extra words needed!
</CultureTip>

## The 5 Essential Grammar Rules for Couples

### 1. **No Cases, No Problem**
Unlike some languages, Danish doesn't use complicated case systems. Words generally stay the same form regardless of their function in the sentence.

### 2. **Two Genders: Common and Neuter**
Danish has two grammatical genders, but don't worry - you'll pick them up naturally:
- **Common gender** (en words): en mand (a man), en kvinde (a woman)
- **Neuter gender** (et words): et hus (a house), et bord (a table)

### 3. **Definite Articles Attach to the End**
Instead of separate words like "the," Danish adds **-en** or **-et** to the end:
- **kæresten** = the boyfriend/girlfriend
- **huset** = the house

### 4. **Verb Conjugation is Blissfully Simple**
Verbs don't change based on who does the action - they stay the same for all subjects!

### 5. **Making Questions is Easy**
Just flip your subject and verb, or add "er det" (is it) for yes/no questions.

## Verb Conjugation Made Simple

Here's the beautiful truth about Danish verbs: they barely change! Learn one form, use it everywhere.

## Romantic Sentence Building Practice

Let's practice with phrases you'll actually use with your partner:

| Danish Phrase | English Translation | Grammar Note |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Du er smuk** | You are beautiful | Basic subject-verb-adjective |
| **Jeg vil kysse dig** | I want to kiss you | Modal verb + infinitive |
| **Kan vi snakke?** | Can we talk? | Question by flipping subject-verb |
| **Kommer du hjem snart?** | Are you coming home soon? | Time expression at the end |
| **Jeg har savnet dig** | I have missed you | Present perfect tense |

<CultureTip flag="🇩🇰" title="Danish Romantic Grammar">
In Danish, you can create extra romantic emphasis by adding "så" (so) before adjectives: "Du er så smuk" (You are so beautiful). Danes also love diminutives - try "lille" (little) for extra affection: "min lille skat" (my little treasure)!
</CultureTip>

## Common Verb Patterns for Daily Couple Life

### Past Tense (add -ede/-te)
- **Vi mødtes** (We met) - "vee MUTH-des"

- **Vi skal giftes** (We're going to get married) - "vee skahl GIFF-des"
