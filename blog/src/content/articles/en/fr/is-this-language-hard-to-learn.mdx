## The Honest Assessment

- **24-30 weeks** to reach general professional proficiency
- **575-600 hours** of study time
- **Much faster** than learning Russian, Arabic, or Chinese

Compared to other languages, French shares **30% vocabulary** with English thanks to the Norman Conquest. Words like "romantic," "restaurant," and "hotel" are practically identical.
