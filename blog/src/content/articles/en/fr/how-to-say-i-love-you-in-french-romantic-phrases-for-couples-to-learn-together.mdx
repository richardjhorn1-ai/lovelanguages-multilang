## Tips for Pronunciation Practice

1. **Practice Together**: Take turns saying phrases to each other
2. **Record Yourselves**: Listen back to improve pronunciation
3. **Use Music**: French love songs are excellent for learning rhythm and pronunciation
4. **Watch French Films**: Notice how actors deliver romantic lines
5. **Start Simple**: Master "Je t'aime" before moving to complex phrases

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't confuse **"Je t'aime"** with **"J'aime"** - the first is "I love you," the second needs an object
- Remember that **"Je vous aime"** is formal - use **"Je t'aime"** with your romantic partner
- **"Amour"** is masculine (mon amour), even when addressing a woman

## Making It Special

Consider these romantic gestures while practicing:
- Write love notes in French
- Plan a French-themed date night
- Cook French cuisine together while practicing phrases
- Take a virtual tour of Paris while declaring your love in French

Learning to express love in French isn't just about memorizing phrases - it's about connecting with your partner through the beauty of language. Every "Je t'aime" you practice together brings you closer and adds a touch of Parisian romance to your relationship.
