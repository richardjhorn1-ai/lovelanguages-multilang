## How to Use These Greetings Together

Create romantic rituals by using these phrases consistently. Start with **Bonjour mon amour** every morning, and end each day with **Je t'aime**. Practice pronunciation together—French is all about the melody of the language.

The key is consistency and authenticity. Don't worry about perfect pronunciation at first. Your partner will appreciate the effort, and you'll improve together. Try recording yourselves saying these phrases, then compare with native speakers.

<CultureTip flag="🇫🇷" title="Timing Matters">
**Bonjour** becomes **Bonsoir** around 6 PM, but there's flexibility. In summer, you might still say **Bonjour** at 7 PM if it's bright outside. Follow your partner's lead!
</CultureTip>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't use **Salut** in formal situations—stick with **Bonjour/Bonsoir** for first meetings
- **Bonne nuit** is only for bedtime, not evening greetings
- **La bise** varies by region—when unsure, ask "On fait la bise ?" (Do we do cheek kisses?)

Learning these greetings and farewells together creates shared moments of connection. Each **Bonjour** becomes a small celebration of your relationship, every **Au revoir** a promise to meet again. Start with just five phrases this week, and watch how naturally French romance enters your daily life.
