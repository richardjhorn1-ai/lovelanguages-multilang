Meeting your partner's family is nerve-wracking enough without a language barrier! Whether you're visiting their childhood home in Provence or having Sunday lunch in Paris, these essential French phrases will help you make a wonderful first impression.

<CultureTip flag="🇫🇷" title="The Art of French Formality">
French families often start with formal greetings (vous) and may gradually become more informal. Always wait for them to suggest using "tu" - never initiate it yourself. This shows respect for family hierarchy and traditions.
