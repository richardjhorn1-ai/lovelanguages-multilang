## The Essential Phrase

<VocabCard
  word="Je t'aime"
  translation="I love you"
  pronunciation="zhuh tem"
  example="Je t'aime plus que tout au monde."
/>

### Pronunciation Guide

The pronunciation of "Je t'aime" has sounds that don't exist in English:

- **Je** [zhuh] - Like the "s" in "measure" followed by a soft "uh"
- **t'aime** [tem] - The apostrophe shows the contraction of "te" and "aime"

**Tip**: Say "zhuh-tem" as one flowing word, almost like singing.

## The Three Levels of Love in French

<CultureTip title="Watch out for 'bien'!" flag="🇫🇷">
In French, adding "bien" to "Je t'aime" makes it LESS intense, not more! "Je t'aime bien" means "I like you" or "I care about you" - like between friends. For romantic love, just say "Je t'aime" without "bien".

| French | English | Intensity | Use |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Je t'aime bien** | I like you | ⭐ | Friends |
| **Je t'aime** | I love you | ⭐⭐⭐ | Partner |
| **Je t'adore** | I adore you | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very intense |

## French Terms of Endearment

|--------|---------|---------|
| **Mon amour** | My love | My love |
| **Mon chéri/Ma chérie** | My darling | My dear |
| **Mon trésor** | My treasure | My treasure |
| **Ma moitié** | My other half | My half |
| **Mon petit chou** | Sweetie | My little cabbage |

<CultureTip title="Unusual but sweet" flag="🇫🇷">
French has some quirky terms of endearment: "mon petit chou" (my little cabbage), "ma puce" (my flea), "mon lapin" (my rabbit). These might sound strange in English but are completely normal and very sweet in French!
