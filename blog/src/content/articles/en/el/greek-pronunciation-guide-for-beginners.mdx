Good pronunciation is the key to being understood - and to making your Greek partner smile when you speak their language. The good news? Greek pronunciation is more consistent than English, and with this guide, you'll be speaking clearly in no time.

## The Greek Alphabet: Your Foundation

First, let's master all 24 letters of the Greek alphabet:

### Vowels (7 letters)

| Letter | Name | Sound | Example Word |
|--------|------|-------|--------------|
| Α α | Alpha | "ah" (as in "father") | αγάπη (love) |
| Ε ε | Epsilon | "eh" (as in "pet") | έρωτας (romance) |
| Η η | Eta | "ee" (as in "see") | ήλιος (sun) |
| Ι ι | Iota | "ee" (as in "see") | ίσως (maybe) |
| Ο ο | Omicron | "oh" (as in "go") | όμορφος (beautiful) |
| Υ υ | Upsilon | "ee" (as in "see") | ύπνος (sleep) |
| Ω ω | Omega | "oh" (as in "go") | ώρα (hour) |

<CultureTip title="Why So Many 'EE' Sounds?" flag="🇬🇷">
You'll notice that η, ι, and υ all make the "ee" sound. This is because ancient Greek had different vowels that merged over time. Don't worry about which to use when writing yet - focus on the sounds first!
</CultureTip>

### Consonants (17 letters)

| Letter | Name | Sound | Example |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| Β β | Beta | "v" | βιβλίο (book) |
| Γ γ | Gamma | soft "gh" or "y" | γάτα (cat) |
| Δ δ | Delta | "th" as in "the" | δρόμος (road) |
| Ζ ζ | Zeta | "z" | ζωή (life) |
| Θ θ | Theta | "th" as in "think" | θάλασσα (sea) |
| Κ κ | Kappa | "k" | καρδιά (heart) |
| Λ λ | Lambda | "l" | λόγος (word) |
| Μ μ | Mu | "m" | μητέρα (mother) |
| Ν ν | Nu | "n" | νερό (water) |
| Ξ ξ | Xi | "ks" | ξέρω (I know) |
| Π π | Pi | "p" | πατέρας (father) |
| Ρ ρ | Rho | rolled "r" | ρόδο (rose) |
| Σ σ/ς | Sigma | "s" | σπίτι (house) |
| Τ τ | Tau | "t" | τι (what) |
| Φ φ | Phi | "f" | φίλος (friend) |
| Χ χ | Chi | "kh" or "h" | χέρι (hand) |
| Ψ ψ | Psi | "ps" | ψυχή (soul) |

## Common Letter Combinations

Greek has several two-letter combinations that produce single sounds:

### Vowel Combinations

| Combination | Sound | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| αι | "eh" | και (and) = "keh" |
| ει | "ee" | είμαι (I am) = "EE-meh" |
| οι | "ee" | ποιος (who) = "pyos" |
| ου | "oo" | πού (where) = "poo" |
| αυ | "av" or "af" | αυτός = "af-TOS" |
| ευ | "ev" or "ef" | ευχαριστώ = "ef-ha-ree-STOH" |

<VocabCard
  word="ευχαριστώ"
  translation="thank you"
  pronunciation="ef-hah-ree-STOH"
  example="Ευχαριστώ πολύ, αγάπη μου."
/>

### Consonant Combinations

| Combination | Sound | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| μπ | "b" or "mb" | μπορώ (I can) = "boh-ROH" |
| ντ | "d" or "nd" | ντομάτα (tomato) = "doh-MAH-tah" |
| γκ | "g" or "ng" | γκαράζ (garage) = "gah-RAHZ" |
| γγ | "ng" | άγγελος (angel) = "AHN-geh-los" |
| τσ | "ts" | τσάι (tea) = "TSAH-ee" |
| τζ | "dz" | τζατζίκι = "dza-DZEE-kee" |

<CultureTip title="Why μπ = 'B'?" flag="🇬🇷">
Modern Greek doesn't have a single letter for the "b" sound (ancient Greek's beta became "v"). To write the "b" sound, Greeks combine μ+π. Similarly, ντ makes the "d" sound. This is why Greek words borrowed from other languages look unusual!
</CultureTip>

## The Trickiest Sounds for English Speakers

### 1. The Gamma (Γ/γ)

This is the most challenging sound for English speakers. It varies based on what follows:

**Before α, ο, ου, ω, or consonants:** A soft, throaty "gh" - like gargling gently

<VocabCard
  word="γάτα"
  translation="cat"
  pronunciation="GHAH-tah"
  example="Η γάτα είναι στο σπίτι."
/>

**Before ε, ι, η, υ, ει, οι, αι:** A "y" sound (like "yes")

<VocabCard
  word="γεια σου"
  translation="hello / goodbye"
  pronunciation="YAH-soo"
  example="Γεια σου, καρδιά μου!"
/>

### 2. The Delta (Δ/δ)

Pronounced like "th" in "the" (voiced), NOT like "th" in "think":

<VocabCard
  word="δουλειά"
  translation="work"
  pronunciation="thoo-LYAH"
  example="Πώς ήταν η δουλειά σου;"
/>

### 3. The Theta (Θ/θ)

Pronounced like "th" in "think" (unvoiced):

<VocabCard
  word="θάλασσα"
  translation="sea"
  pronunciation="THAH-lah-sah"
  example="Πάμε στη θάλασσα αύριο;"
/>

### 4. The Chi (Χ/χ)

A soft "h" or "kh" sound, like clearing your throat gently:

<VocabCard
  word="χαρά"
  translation="joy"
  pronunciation="hah-RAH"
  example="Είσαι η χαρά μου."
/>

### 5. The Rolled R (Ρ/ρ)

Greek R is lightly rolled, similar to Spanish:

<VocabCard
  word="αγάπη"
  translation="love"
  pronunciation="ah-GAH-pee"
  example="Η αγάπη μου για σένα είναι μεγάλη."
/>

## Stress and Accents

Greek words have one stressed syllable, marked with an accent (´):

<VocabCard
  word="αγάπη"
  translation="love"
  pronunciation="ah-GAH-pee"
  example="The stress is on the second syllable: a-GA-pi"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="άγγελος"
  translation="angel"
  pronunciation="AHN-geh-los"
  example="The stress is on the first syllable: AN-ge-los"
/>

**Key rule:** The accent mark tells you exactly where to put the stress. Get this right, and you'll sound much more natural!

<CultureTip title="Stress Matters!" flag="🇬🇷">
In Greek, stress can change meaning. For example: "πότε" (POH-teh) means "when," but "ποτέ" (poh-TEH) means "never." Always pay attention to where the accent mark falls!
</CultureTip>

## Pronunciation Practice: Love Phrases

Let's practice with romantic phrases you'll actually use:

  translation="I love you"
  pronunciation="sah-gah-POH"
  example="Break it down: s + a-ga-PO"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Σ'αγαπώ πολύ"
  translation="I love you very much"
  pronunciation="sah-gah-POH poh-LEE"
  example="Σ'αγαπώ πολύ, καρδιά μου."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Μου έλειψες"
  translation="I missed you"
  pronunciation="moo EH-lee-pses"
  example="Μου έλειψες πολύ σήμερα."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Είσαι όμορφη"
  translation="You are beautiful"
  pronunciation="EE-seh OH-mor-fee"
  example="Είσαι τόσο όμορφη."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Καληνύχτα, αγάπη μου"
  translation="Goodnight, my love"
  pronunciation="kah-lee-NEEKH-tah ah-GAH-pee moo"
  example="Καληνύχτα, αγάπη μου. Όνειρα γλυκά!"
/>

## Common Pronunciation Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Don't Pronounce β as "B"
Greek β = "v" NOT "b"

**Wrong:** "BEE-vlee-oh" for βιβλίο
**Right:** "vee-VLEE-oh"

### 2. Don't Skip the Rolled R
A flat English "r" sounds foreign in Greek. Practice a light tongue tap.

### 3. Don't Over-Aspirate
Greek π, τ, κ are softer than English p, t, k. Don't add a puff of air.

### 4. Watch Your Vowels
Remember: ο and ω are both "oh" - don't make ω longer.

## Quick Pronunciation Reference

| Sound | Greek Letters | Like English... |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| "ah" | α | f**a**ther |
| "eh" | ε, αι | p**e**t |
| "ee" | η, ι, υ, ει, οι | s**ee** |
| "oh" | ο, ω | g**o** |
| "oo" | ου | m**oo**n |
| "v" | β | **v**ery |
| "th" (soft) | δ | **th**e |
| "th" (hard) | θ | **th**ink |
| "gh/y" | γ | (no equivalent) |
| "kh/h" | χ | lo**ch** (Scottish) |

## Tips for Perfect Pronunciation

### 1. Listen to Your Partner
The best pronunciation teacher is right next to you. Ask your partner to say words slowly and imitate them.

### 2. Record Yourself
Compare your pronunciation to native speakers. Your phone's voice recorder is a great tool.

### 3. Practice the Alphabet Daily
Spend 5 minutes each day reciting the alphabet until it becomes automatic.

### 4. Focus on High-Frequency Words
Perfect the pronunciation of common words first: greetings, love expressions, daily vocabulary.

### 5. Don't Be Afraid to Ask
<VocabCard
  word="Πώς το προφέρεις;"
  translation="How do you pronounce it?"
  pronunciation="pos toh proh-FEH-rees"
  example="Ask your partner: Πώς το προφέρεις;"
/>

<CultureTip title="Greeks Appreciate Effort" flag="🇬🇷">
Even if your pronunciation isn't perfect, Greeks will be touched that you're trying. They're generally patient and encouraging with learners. Don't let fear of mistakes stop you from speaking!
</CultureTip>

## Practice Dialogue

Here's a simple dialogue to practice your pronunciation:

**You:** Γεια σου, αγάπη μου! (YAH-soo, ah-GAH-pee moo!)

**Partner:** Γεια σου! Τι κάνεις; (YAH-soo! tee KAH-nees?)

**You:** Είμαι καλά. Σ'αγαπώ! (EE-meh kah-LAH. sah-gah-POH!)

**Partner:** Κι εγώ σ'αγαπώ! (kee eh-GHOH sah-gah-POH!)

Practice this dialogue with your partner until it flows naturally. It contains many of the sounds we've covered!


Mastering Greek pronunciation is a journey, but every word you learn to say correctly brings you closer to your partner's heart. Start with the basics, practice daily, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Your Greek partner will love hearing their language from your lips.
