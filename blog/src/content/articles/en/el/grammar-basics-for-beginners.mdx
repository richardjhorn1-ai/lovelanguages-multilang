Learning Greek with your partner? Understanding the basic grammar structure will transform those beautiful Greek phrases from memorized sounds into meaningful communication. When you can form your own sentences, you'll create deeper connections through authentic conversations. By the end of this guide, you'll both be constructing simple, romantic phrases that go beyond "I love you"—though we've got that covered too in our [guide to saying I love you in Greek](/learn/en/el/how-to-say-i-love-you-in-greek/)!

## Greek Grammar Made Simple

Greek grammar might seem intimidating at first glance, but here's the secret: it's actually quite logical once you understand the patterns. Think of it like learning to dance together—at first you step on each other's toes, but soon you're moving in perfect harmony.

Unlike English, Greek is an inflected language, which means word endings change to show their role in a sentence. But don't worry! We'll focus on the patterns that matter most for couples, not the complex academic rules.

### The Building Blocks: Greek Articles

Greek has definite articles (the word "the") that change based on gender and number. Here's what you need to know:

**Masculine:** ο (o) - pronounced "oh"
**Feminine:** η (ee) - pronounced "ee"
**Neuter:** το (to) - pronounced "toh"

These match the gender of the noun they describe, and yes, Greek assigns gender to objects. But here's a couple's hack: most words ending in -ος are masculine, -η or -α are feminine, and -ο or -ι are neuter.

<VocabCard
  word="ο άντρας"
  translation="the man"
  pronunciation="oh AHN-drahs"
  example="Ο άντρας μου είναι όμορφος."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="η γυναίκα"
  translation="the woman"
  pronunciation="ee yee-NEH-kah"
  example="Η γυναίκα μου είναι έξυπνη."
/>

## Essential Verb: "To Be" (Είμαι)

Being able to describe yourselves and each other is fundamental for couples. The verb "είμαι" (to be) is your gateway to countless romantic expressions:

<ConjugationTable
  verb="Είμαι"
  meaning="to be"
  conjugations={[
    { person: "I", polish: "είμαι", english: "I am" },
    { person: "You (informal)", polish: "είσαι", english: "you are" },
    { person: "He/She", polish: "είναι", english: "he/she is" },
    { person: "We", polish: "είμαστε", english: "we are" },
    { person: "You (plural)", polish: "είσαστε", english: "you all are" },
    { person: "They", polish: "είναι", english: "they are" }

### Practice Together: Basic Descriptions

| Greek Phrase | Translation | Pronunciation | When to Use |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Είμαι ερωτευμένος** | I am in love | EE-meh eh-roh-teh-VEH-meh-nohs | When you're male |
| **Είμαι ερωτευμένη** | I am in love | EE-meh eh-roh-teh-VEH-meh-nee | When you're female |
| **Είσαι όμορφος** | You are handsome | EE-seh OH-mor-fohs | To your male partner |
| **Είσαι όμορφη** | You are beautiful | EE-seh OH-mor-fee | To your female partner |
| **Είμαστε μαζί** | We are together | EE-mahs-teh mah-ZEE | Celebrating your relationship |

<CultureTip flag="🇬🇷" title="Gender Agreement Matters">
In Greek, adjectives must match the gender of the person they're describing. Use -ος endings for males, -η endings for females. This shows respect for the language and your partner!
</CultureTip>

## Possessive Pronouns: Showing Connection

Expressing "my," "your," and "our" is crucial for couples. Greek makes this beautifully simple:

- **μου** (moo) = my
- **σου** (soo) = your (informal)
- **μας** (mahs) = our

These tiny words come AFTER the noun they modify:

<VocabCard
  word="ο αγαπημένος μου"
  translation="my beloved"
  pronunciation="oh ah-gah-pee-MEH-nohs moo"
  example="Είναι ο αγαπημένος μου."
/>

### Romantic Possessives Practice

| Greek | Translation | Pronunciation | Grammar Note |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **η καρδιά μου** | my heart | ee kar-DEE-ah moo | Feminine noun |
| **η ζωή μου** | my life | ee ZOH-ee moo | Shows deep connection |
| **το όνομά σου** | your name | toh OH-noh-mah soo | Neutral noun |
| **η αγάπη μας** | our love | ee ah-GAH-pee mahs | Shared possession |
| **το σπίτι μας** | our home | toh SPEE-tee mahs | Building your life together |

## Question Formation: Getting to Know Each Other

Greek questions are refreshingly straightforward. Just raise your voice at the end, or add question words:

**Basic Questions for Couples:**
- **Είσαι καλά;** (EE-seh kah-LAH?) = Are you okay?
- **Θέλεις να βγούμε;** (THEH-lees nah VGOO-meh?) = Do you want to go out?
- **Μου λείπεις** (moo LEE-pees) = I miss you

<CultureTip flag="🇬🇷" title="The Power of Tone">
Greek relies heavily on intonation. The same phrase can be a statement or question based on how you say it. Practice together—it's like creating your own secret language within Greek!
</CultureTip>

## Common Verb Patterns

Beyond "to be," here are essential verbs every couple needs:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
