Learning the Greek alphabet together as a couple is one of the most rewarding first steps in your language journey. While the script may look unfamiliar at first, you will be surprised how quickly you can master it when you practice together. The Greek alphabet has only 24 letters, and many of them will feel familiar once you understand the sounds they represent.

This guide will take you through every letter, with pronunciation tips, romantic vocabulary to practice, and exercises designed for couples learning together.

## Why Learn the Greek Alphabet First?

Before diving in, understand why mastering the Greek alphabet is essential:

1. **Greek uses a unique script** - Unlike Spanish or French, you cannot simply read Greek using English letters
2. **Transliteration is inconsistent** - Different sources spell Greek words differently in English letters
3. **It unlocks authentic learning** - Reading Greek script opens doors to signs, menus, and love notes from your partner
4. **It is easier than you think** - Many Greek letters look or sound similar to English ones

<CultureTip title="The Birthplace of the Alphabet" flag="GR">
The Greek alphabet, developed around 800 BCE, was the first to include vowels and is the ancestor of the Latin alphabet we use in English. When you learn Greek letters, you are connecting with over 2,800 years of written history.
