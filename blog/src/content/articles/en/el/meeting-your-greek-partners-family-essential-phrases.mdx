Meeting your Greek partner's family is a significant milestone that can feel both exciting and nerve-wracking. Greek families are known for their warmth, close bonds, and genuine hospitality - but they also have high expectations when it comes to welcoming someone into the family circle.

The good news? Making an effort to speak Greek, even imperfectly, will instantly win you points. Greeks deeply appreciate foreigners who try to learn their language and embrace their culture. This guide will prepare you with everything you need to make a wonderful first impression.

## Understanding Greek Family Culture

Before diving into phrases, understand what you are walking into:

<CultureTip title="Greek Family Dynamics" flag="🇬🇷">
Greek families tend to be very close-knit. Children often live with parents until marriage, and grandparents play an active role in family life. Expect your partner's parents to be genuinely interested in your intentions, your background, and your future plans together. This comes from love, not nosiness!
</CultureTip>

## Essential Greetings and Introductions

First impressions matter. These phrases will help you start strong:

<VocabCard
  word="Χαίρω πολύ"
  translation="Pleased to meet you"
  pronunciation="HEH-roh poh-LEE"
  example="Χαίρω πολύ! Είμαι η Σάρα. (Pleased to meet you! I'm Sarah.)"
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Χαίρομαι πολύ που σας γνωρίζω"
  translation="I'm very pleased to meet you"
  pronunciation="HEH-roh-meh poh-LEE poo sahs gnoh-REE-zoh"
  example="Χαίρομαι πολύ που σας γνωρίζω. Ο Γιάννης μου έχει πει πολλά για εσάς. (I'm very pleased to meet you. Yiannis has told me so much about you.)"
/>

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Ευχαριστώ πολύ για την πρόσκληση"
  translation="Thank you very much for the invitation"
  pronunciation="ef-hah-ree-STOH poh-LEE yah teen PROS-klee-see"
  context="Perfect for when you first arrive at their home"
/>

### Formal vs. Informal Address

When meeting parents and older relatives, use the formal "εσείς" (you - plural/formal) rather than "εσύ" (you - singular/informal):

| Informal | Formal | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Πώς είσαι; | Πώς είστε; | How are you? |
| Τι κάνεις; | Τι κάνετε; | How are you doing? |
| Ευχαριστώ | Σας ευχαριστώ | Thank you |

<VocabCard
  word="Πώς είστε;"
  translation="How are you? (formal)"
  pronunciation="pos EE-steh"
  example="Καλησπέρα! Πώς είστε; (Good evening! How are you?)"
/>

<CultureTip title="When to Use Formal Greek" flag="🇬🇷">
Always use the formal form with your partner's parents until they explicitly tell you to use "εσύ" (informal you). They may say "Να μου μιλάς στον ενικό" (speak to me informally) or "Πες μου εσύ" (say 'you' to me). Until then, stay formal - it shows respect.

Expect to be offered food. A lot of food. Then more food. Greek hospitality means your plate will never be empty. Saying "Είμαι χορτάτος/χορτάτη" (I'm full) may not stop them from insisting. Accept with grace and compliment lavishly - this is how Greeks show love!
