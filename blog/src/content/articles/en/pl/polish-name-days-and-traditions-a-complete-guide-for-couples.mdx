Polish culture is rich with beautiful traditions that strengthen family bonds and community connections. As a couple learning Polish together, understanding these customs will help you connect more deeply with Polish speakers and participate meaningfully in their celebrations.

## What Are Name Days?

**Imieniny** (name days) are perhaps more important than birthdays in Polish culture. Each day of the year is dedicated to one or more Catholic saints, and people celebrate on the day assigned to their first name. If your name is Anna, you celebrate on July 26th (St. Anna's day). If you're Piotr, your **imieniny** (name days) fall on June 29th.
