When you're learning Ukrainian for someone you love, there's one phrase that matters more than any other: **"I love you."** In Ukrainian, expressing love carries deep cultural significance and beautiful linguistic nuance that goes far beyond a simple translation.

Let's explore all the ways to say "I love you" in Ukrainian, from everyday expressions to the most romantic phrases that will touch your partner's heart.

## The Essential: Я тебе кохаю

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Я тебе кохаю"
  translation="I love you"
  pronunciation="Ya tebe kokhayu"
  context="The most heartfelt and direct way to express romantic love in Ukrainian."
/>

This is the phrase that matters most. **Я тебе кохаю** (Ya tebe kokhayu) is the standard, sincere way to tell someone you love them in Ukrainian. Unlike casual expressions in some languages, this phrase carries significant emotional weight and is reserved for genuine romantic feelings.

## Understanding the Word Order

You might notice that Ukrainian word order differs from English. In **Я тебе кохаю**:
- **Я** (Ya) = I
- **тебе** (tebe) = you (accusative case)
- **кохаю** (kokhayu) = love (first person singular)

<CultureTip title="The Depth of Ukrainian Love" flag="🇺🇦">
Ukrainians distinguish between **кохати** (kokhaty) for romantic love and **любити** (lyubyty) for general love or liking. When you say "Я тебе кохаю," you're specifically expressing romantic, passionate love - not the same word you'd use for loving pizza or your favorite book!
</CultureTip>

## Two Verbs for Love: Кохати vs Любити

Ukrainian has two words for love, and understanding the difference will help you express yourself perfectly:

<VocabCard
  word="Кохати"
  translation="To love (romantically)"
  pronunciation="ko-HA-ty"
  example="Я кохаю тебе всім серцем."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Любити"
  translation="To love (general) / To like"
  pronunciation="lyu-BY-ty"
  example="Я люблю цю книгу."
/>

For romantic relationships, **кохати** is the word you want. It's passionate, deep, and specifically romantic.
