Meeting your Italian partner's family is a momentous occasion! Italian families are warm, expressive, and deeply connected. Food, love, and family are at the heart of Italian culture. With the right phrases and cultural know-how, you'll be embraced like one of their own.

## The Essential First Greeting

<PhraseOfDay
  word="Piacere di conoscervi"
  translation="Pleased to meet you (plural)"
  pronunciation="pya-CHEH-reh dee koh-NOH-shehr-vee"
  context="The perfect polite greeting when meeting your partner's parents. Use 'Lei' (formal you) until invited to use 'tu'."
/>

## Greeting Italian Style

Italians are warm and physically expressive. Expect cheek kisses (two, starting with the right) and possibly warm embraces from the family.

<VocabCard
  word="Buongiorno, è un piacere conoscerla"
  translation="Good day, it's a pleasure to meet you (formal)"
  pronunciation="bwon-JOHR-no, eh oon pya-CHEH-reh koh-NOH-shehr-la"
  example="Buongiorno Signora, è un vero piacere conoscerla finalmente."
/>

<VocabCard
  word="Sono molto felice di essere qui"
  translation="I'm very happy to be here"
  pronunciation="SOH-no MOHL-toh feh-LEE-cheh dee EHS-seh-reh kwee"
  example="Show genuine warmth and enthusiasm."
/>

<CultureTip title="The Lei/Tu Distinction" flag="🇮🇹">
Italian uses "Lei" (formal) and "tu" (informal) for "you." With your partner's parents, use "Lei" unless they say "Diamoci del tu" (Let's use 'tu'). However, Italian families are often quick to invite informal language - don't be surprised if it happens fast!

## Gift-Giving Etiquette

Bringing a gift is expected and appreciated in Italy!

### Appropriate Gifts

| Italian | English | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Dei fiori** | Flowers | Avoid chrysanthemums (funerals) |
| **Del vino** | Wine | Good quality, perhaps from your region |
| **Dei cioccolatini** | Chocolates | High-quality Italian brands |
| **Una specialità del mio paese** | A specialty from my country | Unique items are valued |
| **Una pianta** | A plant | Long-lasting gift, always appreciated |

<CultureTip title="Gift Presentation" flag="🇮🇹">
Italians appreciate beautiful presentation. Have gifts nicely wrapped. Avoid giving anything in black (mourning color) or purple (bad luck). Odd numbers of flowers are preferred, and never give chrysanthemums - they're strictly for funerals!
</CultureTip>

## At the Dinner Table

Italian meals are sacred family time. Be prepared for multiple courses and LOTS of food!

<VocabCard
  word="Buon appetito!"
  translation="Enjoy your meal!"
  pronunciation="bwon ah-peh-TEE-toh"

<VocabCard
  word="Posso averne ancora?"

/>

<CultureTip title="La Mamma's Cooking" flag="🇮🇹">
The mother's cooking is SACRED in Italy. Compliment it effusively and sincerely. Asking for the recipe is a huge compliment. Be warned: Italian mammas will keep filling your plate. "Ancora un po'?" (A little more?) really means "I'm putting more on your plate."
</CultureTip>

## Wine and Toasts

Wine flows freely at Italian tables. Here's how to participate:

<VocabCard

  translation="To health!"

<CultureTip title="Wine Etiquette" flag="🇮🇹">
Italians drink wine with meals, not before. Don't order a cocktail with dinner! Make eye contact during toasts. It's polite to wait for someone else to fill your glass. And never, ever put ice in wine - that's a cardinal sin in Italy!
</CultureTip>

## Saying Goodbye

<VocabCard
  word="Grazie di tutto, è stata una serata meravigliosa"
  translation="Thank you for everything, it was a wonderful evening"

/>

## Things to Avoid

### Don't:
1. **Refuse food** - At least try everything
2. **Criticize Italian food/culture** - Even jokingly
3. **Be overly reserved** - Italians are expressive, match their energy
4. **Rush the meal** - Italian dinners take hours
5. **Add cheese to seafood pasta** - Culinary crime!

### Do:
1. **Be warm and expressive** - Italians love enthusiasm
2. **Compliment the cooking** - Multiple times!
3. **Ask about family history** - Italians love sharing stories
4. **Try speaking Italian** - They'll adore you for it
5. **Appreciate their regional pride** - Italy is very regional

<CultureTip title="Regional Pride" flag="🇮🇹">
Italy has strong regional identities. Your partner's family may be proudly Sicilian, Tuscan, Neapolitan, or from another region. Show interest in their specific regional cuisine, dialect, and traditions. Asking "Di che regione siete?" (What region are you from?) shows cultural awareness.
</CultureTip>

## Sample Conversation

**You:** Buongiorno! Piacere di conoscervi.
**Parents:** Benvenuto/a! Entra, entra!
**You:** Vi ho portato dei fiori.
**Mom:** Oh che belli! Grazie mille!
**You:** Ho sentito parlare molto di voi.
**Dad:** Siediti, siediti. Cosa vuoi da bere?
**You:** Un bicchiere di vino, grazie.

Good luck meeting the family! With warmth, appreciation for their food, and a few Italian phrases, you'll be welcomed with open arms.
