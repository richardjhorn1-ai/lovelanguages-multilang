### Formal vs. Informal Greetings

When meeting older family members or in-laws, it's crucial to use formal language initially:

| **Come sta?** | [KOH-meh stah] | How are you? (formal) |

With younger family members or siblings, you can be more casual:

- **Ciao, come stai?** [chah-oh, KOH-meh stahy] - Hi, how are you?
- **Piacere di conoscerti** [pee-ah-CHEH-reh dee koh-NOH-sher-tee] - Nice to meet you (informal)
