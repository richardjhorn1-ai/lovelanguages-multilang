## The History of Polish Valentine's Day

**Walentynki** (Valentine's Day) arrived in Poland relatively recently, gaining popularity only after 1989 when the country opened up to Western influences. Before this, Polish couples had their own ways of expressing love, often through poetry, music, and traditional courtship rituals.

Today, **Dzień Świętego Walentego** (Saint Valentine's Day) has become a beloved celebration, though it retains a distinctly Polish character. Unlike the heavily commercialized American version, Polish Valentine's Day maintains a more intimate, personal touch.

<CultureTip title="Traditional Polish Romance">
Before Valentine's Day became popular, Polish couples would exchange handwritten poems and flowers during **Andrzejki** (St. Andrew's Day) on November 30th, which was traditionally associated with love divination and finding one's soulmate.
