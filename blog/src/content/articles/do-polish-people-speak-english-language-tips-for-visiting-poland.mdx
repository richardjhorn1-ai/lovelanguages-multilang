Planning a romantic getaway to Poland with your partner? You're in for a treat! From the charming cobblestone streets of Kraków to the bustling energy of Warsaw, Poland offers couples unforgettable experiences. But one question keeps coming up: "Do Polish people speak English?"

The short answer is: it depends where you go and who you meet. Let's dive into what you can expect and arm you with the essential Polish phrases that will make your trip smoother and more romantic.

<PhraseOfDay
  polish="Dzień dobry"
  english="Good day / Hello"
  pronunciation="jen DOB-ry"
  context="The most important greeting you'll use throughout Poland - polite and universally understood."
/>

## English in Poland: The Real Situation

### Where English is Common

**Tourist areas** in major cities like Warsaw, Kraków, Gdańsk, and Wrocław generally have good English support. You'll find that:

- **Hotel staff** usually speak conversational English
- **Restaurant servers** in tourist districts often know basic English
- **Young people** (especially under 30) frequently speak English well
- **Museums and attractions** typically offer English information
- **Transportation hubs** have English signage and announcements

### Where You'll Need Polish

- **Small towns and villages** - English is rare
- **Local markets** (**targowiska** - tar-go-VEES-ka)
- **Traditional restaurants** outside city centers
- **Older generations** (50+) - they learned Russian or German in school
- **Public transportation** staff
- **Pharmacies** (**apteki** - ap-TEH-kee) and medical facilities

<CultureTip title="Generation Gap">
Poland's history explains the language divide. Older Poles learned Russian during communist times, while younger generations grew up with English in schools and online. Don't be surprised if grandparents speak German better than English - it's historical, not personal preference!
