Hungarian families are typically close-knit with strong intergenerational bonds. When meeting parents, bring a small gift (flowers for mom, wine or chocolates for dad) and always address elders formally until invited to use informal speech. Punctuality is crucial—arrive exactly on time, never early or late.
