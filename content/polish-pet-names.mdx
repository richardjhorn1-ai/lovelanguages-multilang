Polish is a language rich with affectionate expressions. Whether you're just starting to date a Polish speaker or have been together for years, using the right pet name can make your partner's heart melt.

## The Most Popular: Kochanie

<PhraseOfDay
  polish="Kochanie"
  english="Darling / Sweetheart"
  pronunciation="ko-HA-nyeh"
  context="The most universally used and always appropriate term of endearment."
/>

**Kochanie** is derived from the verb **kochać** (to love), making it literally mean "the one I love." You'll hear this everywhere in Poland - between young couples, married partners, and even parents to children.

<CultureTip title="Pronunciation Tip">
The stress in Polish almost always falls on the second-to-last syllable. So it's ko-HA-nyeh, not KO-ha-nyeh.
