# SEO Strategy & Progress Tracker

## Mission
Make Love Languages discoverable by couples searching for **language learning resources across 18 languages**: romantic phrases, cultural content, and couple-focused learning.

**Supported Languages:** English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, German, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Polish, Czech, Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, Hungarian, Turkish

---

## Multi-Language Blog Strategy

The blog supports content for **any native language → any target language** combination:
- URL pattern: `/learn/[nativeLang]/[targetLang]/[slug]/`
- Example: `/learn/en/pl/how-to-say-i-love-you-in-polish/` (English speakers learning Polish)
- Example: `/learn/es/fr/how-to-say-i-love-you-in-french/` (Spanish speakers learning French)

**Current Focus:** Polish content is most developed (legacy). Expanding to all 18 languages.

## Current Status

### Technical Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Migrated blog from React hash routing to Astro static HTML
- [x] Clean URLs: `/learn/[slug]` (crawlable by Google)
- [x] Meta tags: title, description per page
- [x] Open Graph tags for social sharing
- [x] Twitter Card tags
- [x] JSON-LD structured data (BlogPosting, BreadcrumbList)
- [x] Sitemap at `/sitemap-index.xml` (auto-generated by Astro, **2,741 pages**)
- [x] robots.txt configured
- [x] Canonical URLs
- [x] **9 Native Languages**: EN, ES, FR, DE, IT, PT, RU, PL, TR
- [x] **17 Target Languages** per native language
- [x] **960+ hero images** generated with AI

> **Sitemap Note**: The correct sitemap URL is `https://lovelanguages.io/sitemap-index.xml` which points to `sitemap-0.xml`. This is auto-generated by `@astrojs/sitemap` during blog builds. Do NOT create a manual `public/sitemap.xml` - it will conflict with the Astro-generated one.

## Content Generation Tool (Implemented)

### CLI Command
```bash
npm run generate-article "Polish Wedding Phrases"
npm run generate-article "How to Say Beautiful in Polish" -- --category phrases
npm run generate-article "Polish Grammar Basics" -- --difficulty beginner
npm run generate-article "Topic" -- --dry-run     # Preview without saving
npm run generate-article "Topic" -- --force       # Override duplicate check
```

### How It Works
1. **Duplicate Check**: Scans existing articles to prevent similar topics
2. **Claude API**: Generates 1000-1200 word article with MDX components
3. **Validation**: Checks frontmatter, content length, JSX tags, imports
4. **Output**: Ready-to-publish MDX file in `blog/src/content/articles/`
5. **Image Prompt**: Provides detailed prompt for Glif image generation
6. **Tracking**: Logs generation to `article_generations` table

### Features
- **Duplicate detection**: Warns if similar article exists (use `--force` to override)
- **Inline translations**: Every Polish word has English translation in parentheses
- **Dry run mode**: Preview article without saving (`--dry-run`)
- **Shared module**: CLI and API both use `utils/article-generator.ts`

### Requirements
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env`
- Run: `npm install` to get dependencies

### API Endpoint (Optional)
`POST /api/admin/generate-article`
- Admin-only (requires `is_admin` flag in profiles)
- Body: `{ topic: string, category?: string, difficulty?: string }`
- Returns: `{ slug, frontmatter, content, imagePrompt }`

### Tracking Table
Generated articles are tracked in `article_generations` table:
- slug, topic, category, difficulty
- generated_by, generated_at
- word_count, has_image

### Image Generation (Glif MCP)
Use **Z Image Turbo** for hero images - fast and credit-efficient.

```bash
# Glif ID: cmincelxf0000l104qgpz7iaa
# Output: 1024x1024 JPG
# Save to: blog/public/blog/[slug].jpg
```

Prompt style: `"A romantic couple [scene], warm lighting, [theme] theme, lifestyle photography"`

### Future Enhancements
- [x] **Glif MCP integration** - Z Image Turbo for hero images
- [ ] Batch generation from keyword list
- [ ] Auto-publish schedule
- [ ] Google Search Console integration for tracking
