---

## Phase 4: Love Log & Vocabulary System ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE

### Completed
- **Real-time vocabulary extraction** - Words extracted from chat responses instantly
- **Voice mode vocabulary extraction** - Words harvested when voice session ends
- **Complete word data** - Verbs get all 6 conjugations, nouns get gender/plural, adjectives get all 4 forms
- **NewWordsNotification component** - Shows sparkly toast when words are added
- **Love Log cards** - Full conjugation tables, example navigation, pro-tips

### Data Quality Rules (Enforced in API)
- Verbs: ALL 6 persons required for present tense (ja, ty, onOna, my, wy, oni)
- Verbs: Past/future tenses only included if ALL 6 persons can be filled (no partial data)
- Nouns: Gender + plural form required
- Adjectives: All 4 forms required (masculine, feminine, neuter, plural)
- All words: 5 example sentences + pro-tip required

### Remaining Work
- Manual "Sync All Words" button on Progress tab for catching missed words
- Mark messages as harvested to prevent re-processing

### Gamification Ideas

1. **Limited Updates**
   - Free tier: 3 Love Log updates per day
   - Premium: Unlimited updates

2. **Love Garden**
   - Visual garden that grows with vocabulary
   - Each word is a flower/plant
   - Garden blooms as vocabulary expands
   - Milestone achievements (10 words, 50 words, 100 words)

3. **Partner Challenges**
   - "Learn 5 words this week" challenges
   - Partner can send word challenges
   - Celebrate milestones together

4. **Accomplishment Phrases**
   - Work toward being able to say meaningful phrases
   - "I love you" → "I love you with all my heart" → Full love letter
   - Unlock "achievements" for completing phrase milestones

---

## Phase 4.5: Tense Mastery System 🆕 PLANNED

**Goal:** Track and teach verb tenses systematically so learners can express themselves in past, present, future, and imperfective/perfective aspects.

### The Problem
Polish verbs have complex tense systems:
- **Present tense** - 6 conjugations (ja, ty, on/ona, my, wy, oni)
- **Past tense** - 6 conjugations + gender variations (byłem/byłam, byłeś/byłaś, etc.)
- **Future tense** - compound future (będę + infinitive) vs simple future (perfective verbs)
- **Aspect pairs** - Imperfective (ongoing) vs Perfective (completed) actions

**Current limitations:**
1. We only extract tenses that are discussed in that specific conversation
2. No mechanism to ADD new tenses to existing words later
3. Past tense schema lacks gender support (only stores one variant per person)
4. No tracking of which tenses the user has actually practiced/mastered

### Proposed Features

1. **Tense Progress per Verb**
   - Track which tenses user has practiced for each verb
   - Visual indicator: "Present ✅ | Past ⬜ | Future ⬜"
   - Unlock tenses progressively (master present → learn past → learn future)

2. **Aspect Awareness**
   - Link verb pairs: robić (impf) ↔ zrobić (pf)
   - Teach when to use each aspect
   - "You learned 'jeść' - now learn the perfective 'zjeść' for completed eating"

3. **Tense-Specific Drills**
   - Practice only past tense conjugations
   - Practice only future tense expressions
   - Mixed tense challenges ("Say 'I ate' then 'I will eat'")

4. **Contextual Tense Teaching**
   - "Yesterday I..." → triggers past tense vocabulary
   - "Tomorrow I will..." → triggers future tense
   - Natural conversation flow introduces appropriate tenses

### Database Schema Changes Needed

**1. Fix past tense conjugation storage (dictionary table JSONB):**
```typescript
// CURRENT (incomplete - no gender)
conjugations: {
  past: { ja: "byłem", ty: "byłeś", onOna: "był", ... }
}

// PROPOSED (with gender support)
conjugations: {
  past: {
    ja: { masculine: "byłem", feminine: "byłam" },
    ty: { masculine: "byłeś", feminine: "byłaś" },
    onOna: { masculine: "był", feminine: "była", neuter: "było" },
    my: { masculine: "byliśmy", feminine: "byłyśmy" },
    wy: { masculine: "byliście", feminine: "byłyście" },
    oni: { masculine: "byli", feminine: "były" }
  }
}
```

**2. New tables for tense tracking:**
```sql
-- Track tense mastery per verb per user
CREATE TABLE verb_tense_progress (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  word_id UUID REFERENCES dictionary(id),  -- the verb entry
  tense VARCHAR(20),  -- 'present', 'past', 'future'
  mastery_level INT DEFAULT 0,  -- 0-5 scale
  last_practiced TIMESTAMP,
  correct_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  incorrect_count INT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Link aspect pairs
CREATE TABLE aspect_pairs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  imperfective_word_id UUID REFERENCES dictionary(id),
  perfective_word_id UUID REFERENCES dictionary(id),
  UNIQUE(imperfective_word_id, perfective_word_id)
);
```

**3. Mechanism to update existing words:**
- When a known verb is discussed in a new tense context
- MERGE new tense data into existing entry (don't skip or overwrite)

### Success Criteria
- User can see which tenses they've mastered for each verb
- System suggests "learn past tense of kochać" when ready
- Aspect pairs are linked and taught together
- Progress feels like unlocking abilities, not memorizing tables

---

## Phase 5: Playground / Learning Environment 🆕

**Goal:** Transform passive chat into active learning with structured practice.

### Building Blocks

1. **Flash Cards**
   - Spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2 variant)
   - Audio pronunciation (Web Speech API → Google Cloud TTS upgrade path)
   - User-recorded pronunciation comparison
   - Progress tracking

2. **Word-Specific Practice** (from Love Log)
   - "Practice This Word" button on Love Log cards
   - Sends word to a focused practice queue
   - Test the word in different contexts:
     - Translation recall (Polish → English)
     - Reverse recall (English → Polish)
     - Fill-in-the-blank sentences
     - Conjugation drills (for verbs)
     - Listening comprehension (hear → identify)
   - Links back to Love Log card after practice

### Backend: Priority & Spaced Repetition (Hidden from User)

**Importance Score (1-5)** - Set by AI during harvest, not displayed:
- 5 = Core survival Polish (cześć, dziękuję, proszę)
- 4 = High-frequency verbs/phrases
- 3 = Common vocabulary
- 2 = Situational/specific
- 1 = Nice-to-know, rare

**Spaced Repetition Fields:**
- `ease_factor`: How easy this card is for user (default 2.5)
- `interval_days`: Days until next review
- `repetitions`: Consecutive correct answers
- `next_review`: Calculated optimal review date

**Practice Priority Formula:**
```
priority = (importance × 2) + (days_overdue × 1.5) - (success_rate × 0.5)
```
- High priority = Important + Overdue + Struggling
- Low priority = Less important + Recently practiced + Mastered
- Goal: Optimal challenge - cards appear at the edge of forgetting

2. **Role-Playing Scenarios**
   - User-prompted or curated situations
   - AI plays the other character
   - Extract learning phrases from each scenario
   - Test competency after completion

### Scenario Ideas
| Scenario | Key Phrases | Difficulty |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Going to the movies | "Two tickets please", "What time?" | Beginner |
| Shopping for groceries | "How much?", "Do you have...?" | Beginner |
| Booking a holiday | "I'd like to reserve", dates, prices | Intermediate |
| Meeting a new friend | Introductions, hobbies, questions | Beginner |
| Meeting partner's parents | Formal greetings, compliments, polite phrases | Intermediate |
| Restaurant ordering | Menu items, dietary needs, paying | Beginner |
| Doctor's appointment | Symptoms, body parts, instructions | Intermediate |
| Job interview | Professional intro, experience, questions | Advanced |

### User-Prompted Scenarios
- User describes a situation they want to practice
- AI generates appropriate dialogue and vocabulary
- Extract key phrases to Love Log
- Quiz user on learned content

### Competency Testing
- After each scenario, quick quiz on key phrases
- Track mastery level per scenario
- Suggest when to revisit based on forgetting curve

- **Session Length Selection** - Choose 10, 20, or All questions
- **Streak-Based Mastery System:**
  - Track `correct_streak` per word
  - Word marked as "LEARNED" after 5 consecutive correct answers
  - Wrong answer resets streak to 0 (full reset)
  - No decay - once learned, always learned
- **Mastery Badges in Love Log:**
  - Green checkmark for fully learned words
  - Amber progress indicator showing streak (e.g., "3/5")
- **Score Tracking:**
  - Real-time correct/incorrect counters
  - Immediate feedback for answers

### Database Schema Added
```sql
ALTER TABLE scores
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS correct_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS learned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL;
```

### Original Planning (below)

### The Problem
Users practice vocabulary through Flashcards, Multiple Choice, and Type It modes, but this data isn't being captured to improve their learning experience. We're missing opportunities to:
1. Identify words they consistently struggle with
2. Track which question types they find difficult
3. Generate targeted practice that addresses specific weaknesses
4. Adapt difficulty based on performance patterns

### Data Capture Strategy

**1. Play Session Tracking**

Capture every interaction in the Play section:

```typescript
interface PlaySessionResult {
  user_id: string;
  word_id: string;
  mode: 'flashcard' | 'multiple_choice' | 'type_it';
  direction: 'polish_to_english' | 'english_to_polish';
  correct: boolean;
  response_time_ms: number;  // How long to answer
  user_answer?: string;      // For type_it mode
  timestamp: string;
}
```

**2. Aggregate Performance Metrics**

Calculate per-word and per-user statistics:

```typescript
interface WordPerformance {
  word_id: string;
  total_attempts: number;
  correct_count: number;
  accuracy: number;           // 0.0 - 1.0
  avg_response_time_ms: number;
  last_practiced: string;
  struggle_score: number;     // Higher = needs more practice
  best_mode: string;          // Mode with highest accuracy
  worst_mode: string;         // Mode with lowest accuracy
  direction_preference: 'polish_to_english' | 'english_to_polish' | 'balanced';
}
```

**3. Weakness Detection Algorithm**

```typescript
function calculateStruggleScore(performance: WordPerformance): number {
  const accuracyWeight = (1 - performance.accuracy) * 40;
  const recencyWeight = daysSince(performance.last_practiced) * 2;
  const volumeBonus = Math.min(performance.total_attempts, 10) * -1; // More practice = lower score
  const slowResponsePenalty = performance.avg_response_time_ms > 3000 ? 10 : 0;

  return accuracyWeight + recencyWeight + volumeBonus + slowResponsePenalty;
}
```

### AI Challenge Generation

**1. Challenge Types**

| Challenge | Description | Triggers When |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Word Blitz** | Rapid-fire on 5 weakest words | Struggle score > 50 on 5+ words |
| **Reverse Practice** | Flip direction (EN→PL if usually PL→EN) | Direction imbalance detected |
| **Conjugation Drill** | Focus on verb forms | Verb accuracy < 70% |
| **Context Builder** | Use words in sentences | Single-word answers too slow |
| **Listening Challenge** | Audio-based questions | Strong visual, weak audio performance |
| **Speed Round** | Timed responses | Response times improving |
| **Recovery Session** | Gentle practice on failed words | After poor session |

**2. AI Prompt Template**

```typescript
const challengePrompt = `
Generate a personalized Polish practice challenge for this learner:

**Their Weak Words:**
${weakWords.map(w => `- ${w.word} (${w.translation}): ${w.accuracy}% accuracy`).join('\n')}

**Challenge Requirements:**
- Focus on the 5 words with lowest accuracy
- Create ${questionCount} questions mixing Multiple Choice and Type-It
- Include context sentences that use the words naturally
- Add encouraging feedback for correct answers
- Explain the correct answer if they get it wrong
- Track if they're improving during the challenge

**Tone:** Warm, romantic (this is a couples' language app)
`;
```
